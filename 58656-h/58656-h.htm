<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS is a new sort of book, and unique. That
is why I look upon the permission to write
a brief preface for it as a rare privilege. Writings
on children are frequent. When, in 1875, I
contributed, for Karl Gerhardt’s immense <i>Handbuch</i>,
my <i>Hygiene of the Child</i>, I quoted seven
hundred treatises or pamphlets on that subject.
There are now at least seven thousand of the kind,
and the number of text-books on the diseases
of children and infants do no longer lead a pardonable,
rarely a laudable, existence. A few monographs
on special subjects, or modern publications,
as Erich Wulffen’s <i>The Child: His Nature and
Degeneration</i> (Berlin, 1913), or the two large
anthropological volumes by H. Ploss, <i>The Child
in the Customs and Morals of Nations</i> (third edition
by B. Renz, 1911), are praiseworthy examples
of useful books. But while these are instructive
they do not rouse historical interest.</p>

<p>Indeed, the history of the child has been grossly
neglected. The epoch-making works of Rosenstein,
Charles West, Rilliet and Barthez, and
Karl Gerhardt contain no history. The work of
Puschmann (Neuberger and Pagel) fills twenty
pages with the history of the child in a text of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">v</a></span>
three thousand pages relating to the history of
medicine. Altogether our country has been disrespectful
to its best possessions, viz., the children.
There was until a few decades ago not even a
professional teaching of the children’s diseases
in our medical schools. A regular chair was
established in 1860 (New York Medical College),—it
lasted for a few years only. The second was
in 1898 (Harvard). There were few child’s
hospitals or wards in hospitals until a few years
ago, even in the largest cities. Society, law,
humanitarianism did not mind children. It is
only a few months that an official publication in our
democratic country carried the title; “Is There a
Need of a Child Labour Law?” and our civilization
was humbled by medical discussion of the advisability
of killing the deformed or unpromising
new-born. It seems to take a long time before
this republic of ours begins to work out of the ruts
of semi-barbarism. And now, at last, there is a
book to supply our wants.</p>

<p>Laymen have advanced ahead of the medical
profession. Christ and the Stoics, the clergy and
the public opinion of the Crusades and the Christian
sentiments of the Mediæval Church, aye, the
great slaughterer and revolutionary reformer,
Napoleon, have called the children under their
protection and benefactions.</p>

<p>A vast amount of study relating to primary
populaces and nations in gradual development
was required to learn the history of the child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
Without the history of the child there cannot be
a scientific knowledge of the thousands of years of
child life. Nobody has given it until the author
of this book afforded us the wealth of his vast
studies. This book furnishes what no other
work presents to us. I know of none which
acquaints us with the position of the child in his
social, political, and humanitarian existence in all
nations and in all eras. Adults and adult life
have long been served by the endeavours of
historians, philosophers, and psychologists. We
do not believe in completeness of our knowledge
unless all that have been perfected. Medical men
do not believe in possessing a scientific grasp of
any of their subjects without an embryological basis.
Statesmen, aye, even politicians, of the better
class, insist upon an ample knowledge of the
history of their countries, their institutions, and
their laws. That is how the last years of our
medical and professional life in this country have
developed amongst us physicians the taste for
history and such books as Fielding Garrison has
been able to prepare for us within the last year.</p>

<p>When I said the book before us was unique, I
meant to say that it is a special monograph of the
life through thousands of years of slow physical,
domestic, economic, social existence of the child.
No historian, no medical practitioner or teacher,
surely no existing pediatrist will be without it.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE introduction of Dr. Jacobi has saved
the author from the onerous task, ofttimes
a graceless one, of writing extended prefatory
remarks. It was in the course of some researches
into the origin of the Child Protection
movement in this country that I discovered how
little attention had been paid to the historical
aspect of this important question. This book
represents really a process of elimination, behind
which were many fascinating byways, alluring
blind alleys, and seeming countless beckoning
theories. Toward the last, for a person with
human instinct writing on a humane subject, it
was hard not to tilt. In the main, however, the
author believes that he has hewed to the line.</p>

<p>The author is indebted for many courtesies to
the officials of the New York Public Library, likewise
to the Congressional Library at Washington,
the British Museum at London, and the Bibliothèque
Nationale at Paris. His thanks are due
also to Dr. C. C. Williamson, formerly Chief of
the Economics Division of the New York Public
Library, who took a deep and serious interest in
the work; to Professor Richard Gottheil of Columbia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
for many helpful suggestions in connection
with the Semitics studies; to Professor Hiram
Bingham of Yale, for some helpful notes on the
Incas; to Mr. A. S. Freidus, Chief of the Jewish
Division of the New York Public Library; to
Professor Adolf Deissmann, of the University of
Berlin; to Mr. Elbridge T. Gerry, whose library
provided a wealth of material; to the late Thomas
D. Walsh, Superintendent of the New York S. P.
C. C., a humanitarian of the first water; to Mr.
Jesse B. Jackson, Mr. W. J. Yerby, Mr. Charles
H. Allbrecht, and Mr. E. A. Wakefield, all of the
American Consular Service; to Mr. J. William
Davis, for supervision of the Bibliography; to Mr.
Gabriel Schlesinger, for assistance in reading the
proofs; and, above all, to Mr. Robert E. MacAlarney,
of Columbia University, to whose sustaining
criticism and deep personal interest the author
owes more than can be here set down.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>MATERNAL AFFECTION THE BEGINNING OF HUMAN
ALTRUISM—SYMPATHY AND PARENTAL LOVE THE
BASIS OF OTHER VIRTUES—THE WEAKEST SACRIFICED
IN ALL PRIMITIVE SOCIETY—NEGLECTED
CHAPTERS IN THE HISTORY OF THE ATTITUDE OF
SOCIETY TOWARD CHILDREN.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>F it were possible to postulate the first definite
concept of the first family that crossed the
vague and age-consuming frontier between
animality and humanity, it would be safe to say
that this primitive and almost animal mind would
reach for an approximation, on the part of the
male, to the maternal affection.</p>

<p>In the gathering of food and the making of
protective war, many animals are the rivals in
instinct and intelligence of primitive man. Continued
development in that regard might have
produced a race of men “formidable among animals
through sheer force of sharp-wittedness,”
but not <i>homo sapiens</i>. In the passage from animality
to humanity, there was not only mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
evolution, but moral, and the developing mind
would naturally exercise itself for days and years,
and perhaps for long periods around that one
emotion—the love of the female for its young—an
emotion he was incapable of understanding,
but the outward manifestations of which he would
be bound to imitate.</p>

<p>Whether man was led to an understanding of
the maternal affections by the “sensuous aspects
of the newly-born progeny” appealing to man
himself,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> or through pity and sympathy, as Spencer
suggests, or still more through imitation of the
maternal delight, he undoubtedly would be led to a
higher mental plane as he slowly came to understand
that the maternal affection was not self-gratifying
in the sense that marked the entire
gamut of his own emotions up to that time.</p>

<p>Even in recent times tribes have been found so
low in the social scale that coition and child-birth
have been assumed to have no relation, the latter
phenomenon being explained by ascribing to certain
trees the power to make women fructile.
In a society as low in mentality as this, it would
be easy to conceive that the woman’s unselfishness—her
lack of the self-gratifying impulse—in
protecting, nursing, and rearing a burden superimposed
on her with no pleasurable antecedents,
would be even more amazing than it would be to
the male living in a state sufficiently advanced to
understand the reproductive function.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>
<p>In either state of society, there then begins in
the human consciousness a disturbance “which
is significant of something having another value
than that of mere pleasure, and which is pregnant
with the promise of another than the merely
sensuous or merely intellectual life.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The words
quoted are Prof. Ladd’s, discussing the philosophy
of conduct of civilized man—but here, even in
the primitive man, the rule applies—the moral
idea is born, legitimately enough, out of the altruistic
maternal affection.</p>

<p>Not infrequently one comes across such expressions
as “when man became civilized,” starting
always the baffling inquiry—what civilized man?
The mystery of life, as Bergson suggests, may be
its solution, for in the acquired tendency of looking
on the world as containing one emotion at
least that was not purely self-gratifying, man was
preparing himself for the virtues that followed in
the wake of his own first altruistic concept. The
loyalty without which there could be no sociality
has, on the one hand, a reasoned basis—the selfish
and protecting one that may also explain the gregariousness
of animals—but it differs from gregariousness
by subordinating to the good of another
one’s own pleasure, just as the mother subordinates
her wishes to the pleasure and good of the
infant. It is, in fact, the developed emotion that
the male acquires through imitation and sympathy
from the female, for, “when a tendency splits up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
in the course of its development, each of the special
tendencies which thus arise, tries to preserve and
develop everything in the primitive tendency that
is not incompatible with the work for which it is
specialized.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>Back of this sociological “leap” is Nature’s
long preparation. “The stability of animal marriage,”
says Wundt,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> “seems in general to be
proportional to affection for the young,” and yet
the primitive instincts are sometimes so powerful
that even among those animals in whom the
maternal instinct is strongly developed, they will,
even after facing great danger for their young,
desert them when the time comes to migrate.
This Darwin says is true of swallows, house martins,
and swifts.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>But even in the lowest animals the “chief
source of altrusim” is the family group as it revolves
round the care of the young,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> while with
the increase in the representative capacity that
differentiates man from the brute, and the prolongation
of the period of human infancy, there
is born real altruism, the germ of morality, through
the “knitting together of permanent relations
between mother and infant, and the approximation
toward steady relations on the part of the
male parent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>How then does it happen that an instinct that
has been productive of so much for humanity, an
instinct that has given birth to most of those virtues
that mark civilized from savage man,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> served
apparently so little as a safeguard for the offspring
that generated the moral evolution? Studying
the cross currents and the ever-present struggle
for existence of the various nations that worked
out of barbarism to civilization, we see that after
all it is by and through the very virtues, tenderness,
sympathy, and humanity, that were first
aroused by the helpless offspring, that the infant
comes in turn to be protected, though the path is
frequently a tortuous one.</p>

<p>The society that was able to exist in primitive
times was always the one that sacrificed the individual,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
and the infant was naturally low in the
scale of value. That very sacrifice of the weakest,
stratified into a national characteristic, produced
in the greatest civilization of ancient times, a
narrow and egoistical morality, with little conception
of what we call humanity. “No Greek ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
attained the sublimity of such a point of view,”
says George Henry Lewes.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>In this, the “century of the child,” there is a
great conception of humanity, and even of children’s
rights. Little attempt, however, has been
made to trace in consecutive and co-ordinate
fashion the development among races and nations
of the progress of the human race in its attitude
toward children. We who are so much interested
in the betterment of the race and who are so much
moved by humanitarian considerations that almost
the first consideration of the state is to provide
for the children, have reached this point of view
only after a long struggle against blind ignorance
and reckless selfishness.</p>

<p>The fact that less than fifty years have passed
since we began a definite policy concerning the
rights of children shows how rapidly the human
race moves. The race may be, let us say, something
like 240,000 years old; of that time civilized
man—accepting the most generous figures on
Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilization—has
existed only 10,000 years, or 1/240 of the life of
the human species.</p>

<p>Humanized man has existed not more than a
few hundred years, and it is within only fifty
years that the race has been concerned with the
protection of the child. How deeply ingrained
are the habits of barbarity and darkness, may
be seen from the fact that cannibalism broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
out in Japan not more than a hundred years
ago.</p>

<p>Unquestionably, this is the century of the child.
Undoubtedly, more serious thought is being given
in the present generation to the subject than has
ever been given before in the entire history of the
world. More has been written about the child in
the last fifty years than had been written in the
world in all civilized times up to the beginning of
this half-century. In order to appreciate this
statement one must remember that the best
friends of the child—Jesus, the Jewish Prophets,
and Mohammed—lived centuries before the human
theories that they preached had really a living
existence.</p>

<p>In this connection, it is germane to state that the
theory that philosophy and religion go hand in
hand with humanity, is shattered by the fact that
Plato, Aristotle, Confucius, and Gautama affected,
apparently, not a single jot, the ancient attitude of
insufferance toward the undesired children.</p>

<p>There has ever been, on the question of his
children, a struggle between man and nature.
Endowed with the possibilities of a large offspring
man has fought the burdens that nature has thrust
upon him. On first view, it seems that parental
affection never develops to great degree unless the
economic conditions are favourable; yet the various
artifices and “laws” used by tribes to get rid
of children would show that parental affection
kept struggling with the inclinations of men. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
other words, if we find, as we do, female children
sacrificed in one place because they are useless,
and all first-born children sacrificed in another
place because the gods must be propitiated, it is
evident that parental affection (as represented by
the women) was strong enough to force the male
sovereigns to invent plausible excuses and taboos
in order to have the women give up their offspring.</p>

<p>Considering all that is being done, said, and
written on the subject of the child and the relation
of the state and citizen toward the child, it
would seem safe to assume that there would be
some interest in the attitude of our predecessors
toward children.</p>

<p>From the regulation of Romulus, as set forth by
Dionysius Halicarnassus, to the story of Mary
Ellen, as set forth by a settlement worker on the
East Side of New York City, is a far cry, but the
progress from the first to the second is steady.
The Roman General, Agathocles, who made as a
part of the terms of peace with the Carthaginians
an agreement on the part of that branch of the
Semitic race that they would cease to sacrifice
children, was a legitimate sociological progenitor
of the representative of the arm of the law that
stops a drunken father from beating his child and
creates a Children’s Court where the child gets
gentleness with justice, not contamination and
corruption.</p>

<p>“Every historian ought to be a jurist; every
jurist ought to be a historian,” says Ortolan, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>the historian of child progress feels not only the
truth of that statement but the added necessity
of meeting the various economic theories that
have dealt with the care of the child, from those
of Lycurgus to the latter-day essay of Malthus.</p>

<p>The law of primogeniture and the varying laws
of inheritance have occasionally led to the study
of children as children, but generally the main
interest in them of historian and jurist has been
as a channel for the transmission of property.</p>

<p>Theories about population and the fascinating
pursuit of unravelling tangled economic laws, have
obscured the fact that the attitude of a state toward
children has been, with few variations, an
index to its social progress. The same thing has
been said of women, but while the Greeks treated
women well, yet with the exception of the single
<i>dema</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> of Thebes, infanticide was common in all
the Greek States.</p>

<p>The Chinese are kind to their women and yet
there is no country today where infanticide is more
common. The oldest civilization in the world, the
Babylonian, was not one in which women were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
ill-treated, yet all the indications are that infanticide
was practised in the shape of human
sacrifice.</p>

<p>The Rajputs of India pleaded for their privilege
of destroying infant children when theirs had been
the highest civilization in the world.</p>

<p>In other words, disinterested affection for the
infant is not necessarily coincident with civilization,
or the kind treatment of women a sure sign
that the lives of children are safe.</p>

<p>Various writers, including Walt Whitman,
Nietzsche, and Edward Carpenter, have taken the
attitude that our much vaunted civilization does
not really represent progress, and one vivacious
author<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> has even undertaken to show in a clever
and lively way that there is no such thing as
progress, pointing to Greek civilization, in which
children were killed at will and public men were
confessed degenerates, as the ideal from which we
of modern times have fallen away.</p>

<p>What is undoubtedly true is that civilization
does not always indicate social progress, and what
is truer is that civilization does not necessarily
indicate the <i>humanization</i> of the people.</p>

<p>Chremes, the very character in Terence<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> who
says “Nothing human is alien to me,” is the
one who reproves his wife for not having gotten
rid of their child. The advance over Homer as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
shown by Virgil is that of a great gentleness, a
great humaneness,—a difference in their times,—and
yet Cicero, who represents the stoical and
gentler sentiments of the Virgilian times toward
the helpless and powerless victims of force as did
no man up to his day, speaks tolerantly of the
inhuman practices of his time. But there is a
growth of humaneness from Homer to Virgil,
there is advance from Plato to Cicero, humanely
speaking of course; there was greater advance in
the teachings of Christ, and there was further advance
in the course of the long-drawn-out struggle
between the nominal acceptance of those teachings
and their incorporation into the daily philosophy.
So, too, progress in the care of the rights of infancy
and childhood has been made very little by very
little.</p>

<p>It is the fact that, until 1874, there was no organized
movement to defend the “rights” of children
that led the author to investigate the conditions
that had existed previous to that time. The first
Child’s Protective Movement began in New York
in the year mentioned, and the rapidity with which
this spread throughout the world indicated that
some general law, or as Brinton says, psychological
process was at work. Today there are protecting
societies in every country where there are
Caucasian peoples. To go to the sources of the
Child Protection Movement, it was necessary to
understand the industrial conditions which arose
in the nineteenth century, the eighteenth cen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>tury,
and the latter part of the seventeenth, when
the boast was made that children were at last
being made useful.</p>

<p>Back of the misuse of children in factories is the
interesting story of the rise of modern industrialism
with the early attempts of the guilds to protect
children, not so much out of any development
of the human feelings as from the guild’s desire to
protect the male labourer from unfair competition.</p>

<p>The Decree of Napoleon in 1811,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> declaring that
the unprotected infant was a charge on the state,
marked another advance in humanitarianism;
back of this advance was the long and interesting
story of the endeavours of the religious orders and
the charitably disposed persons of the Middle
Ages to save the lives of children, the most conspicuous
benefactor of childhood being the noble
St. Vincent de Paul. It was he who gave to the
golden glories of France’s golden age a touch of
humanity that would otherwise have been lacking
in the epoch ruled over by Mazarin and later the
Great Louis.</p>

<p>Leading up to the efforts of St. Vincent de Paul
was that complex and interesting chapter of the
mixing of the old German laws with the Roman
laws, as the barbarians found them.</p>

<p>That the semi-barbarous tribes that descended
on Rome were better qualified to take up the humane
side of the Christian work than was the decadent
Roman, we can assume from the statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
of Tacitus, that among the Germans children were
treated more kindly than they were by the then
ruling lords of the earth.</p>

<p>Satire there may have been, as Guizot and Voltaire
suggest, in much that Tacitus wrote about the
superior morality of the Germans, but later history
demonstrated their ethical superiority over
the nation that was then on the verge of moral
decay.</p>

<p>In any case, as the Christian religion spread
among the tribes that had enfiladed Rome, there
are evidences of more humane consideration for
children until we find Bishop Datheus as early as
787 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> founding an asylum for children in a
spirit strangely in advance of his time, though the
bitter protests of the Christian fathers in the
second century against the slaughter and misuse
of children put the mark of infamy on the persecutors
of children for all time.</p>

<p>The Roman laws, as the barbarians found them,
were the result of a slow growth of a thousand
years from the time when the founder attempted
to check the slaughter of young children by what
must have been, in those primitive times, more or
less drastic legislation. That the teachings of
Christ and the teachings of the Stoics led to the
same result does not detract from the credit due
to Christianity for first putting on its proper basis,
as we see things now, the standing of the child
in the matter of its <i>rights</i>.</p>

<p>Back of the Roman developments is the Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
attitude toward children, disappointing, if we look
for the perfection that we find in art and in philosophy,
doubly disappointing when we find that
both Plato and Aristotle saw the child only as a
possibility—only as something of which we must
await developments—only as a human <i>ovum</i>.</p>

<p>When we come to trace the attitude of other
races, of other civilizations, toward children, we
find much the same story: out of barbarism, civilization;
out of civilization, humanity, though it has
been usually the great Semitic religions—Judaism,
Christianity, and Mohammedanism—that have
awakened the humane instinct the world over. The
humane teachings of the Stoics were not unlike
those of the great religious teachers, but, lacking
the intense driving power of religious fervour, it
is doubtful if they could have accomplished the
revolutions that these three religions did.</p>

<p>That all the great nations, the historical divisions
of the races, or those that passed out of
barbarism into civilization, carried with them some
trace of early cannibalistic days or child-murder
days, seems a safe conclusion; and while occasional
followers and interpreters of the Malthusian
philosophy have at times attempted to defend
indirectly these practices as part of the checks and
balances by which over-population is defeated,
the fact remains that the development of the
parental instinct, the greatest of civilizing forces,
has slowly, but surely, tended to put an end to
these “checking” and “balancing” practices.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>HUMAN MARRIAGE—EVOLUTION OF THE PARENTAL
INSTINCT—SOCIAL CONDITIONS AMONG PAPUANS—CHILD’S
PLACE IN THE TRIBE.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T is now believed by many scientists that the
cradle of the human race was the Indo-Malaysian
intertropical lands.</p>

<p>The discovery of the remains of the <i>Pithecanthropus
erectus</i> in 1892 by Dr. Eugene Dubois in
the pliocene beds of East Java, established as a
strong probability what was up to that time regarded
as a mere speculation. Keane<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and Sir
John Evans<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> now assert that man originated in
the East in this vicinity and migrated thence to
Europe.</p>

<p>In this semi-glacial period, man, having taken
on much of his human character and being now an
erect animal (although in physical and mental
respects he still resembled his nearest kin), had
little difficulty in migrating.</p>

<p>During the immensely long old Stone Age to
which Peroché assigns a period of some three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
hundred thousand years since the beginning of the
Ghellian epoch, the pleistocene precursors underwent
very few or slight specializations or developments,
a fact due mainly to the moderate and
unchanging character of the climate during this
long period. Progress in the arts, however, there
was, to such an extent that in some things the
period has not been equalled. Of this character
are the exquisitely wrought flints of the Silurian
period, which cannot be reproduced now.</p>

<p>Primitive man as he existed in the Stone Age
had very little in common with the “primitive
men” of today. There are savages today who
represent, in a way, a degree of savagery and a
remoteness from civilization that in some respects
takes them farther down the social ladder than
any of the Aryan race of the Stone Age. “No
pure primitive race exists in any part of the world
today.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Contact with more advanced races
has invariably produced, sometimes a good and
sometimes an evil effect. Races are what climate,
soil, diet, pursuits, and inherited character make
them,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and the Aryan savages of the Stone Age
had a different set of these conditions to face from
the Negro savages of today.</p>

</div>

<p>It is not surprising to find today a race that in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>many respects represents the Stone Age period of
civilization, displaying, together with the most
barbarous customs, a wide knowledge of the arts,
indicating that there had been contact with some
higher race or its representatives.</p>

<p>Tribes grade into one another in the matter of
culture so that it is hard to classify them.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> A
struggle for existence may leave its mark on an
advanced tribe so that while it may in general
retain prominent barbaric or primitive characteristics,
it will, in every other regard but these, seem
an advanced tribe. The Nigritans, for instance,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
have learned from their neighbours, the Abyssinians
and the Arabs, the use of iron; yet they have
not arrived at the Stone and Bronze ages in culture,
and show in their social relations and domestic
habits none of the characteristics of the more
advanced tribes.</p>

<p>So in the treatment of children. Wherever the
treatment of the child is at variance with the other
customs or conditions of the race, it will almost
invariably be discovered that the change is due
to economic reasons or to contact with a stronger
race. That it is this contact with higher races
that has helped undeveloped races to advance, is
the opinion of Sir H. H. Johnson.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>“In some respects I think the tendency of the
Negro for several centuries past has been an actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
retrograde one. As we come to read the unwritten
history of Africa by researches into languages,
manners, customs, traditions, we seem to see a
backward rather than a forward movement going
on for some thousand years past—a return towards
the savage and even the brute. I can believe it
possible that, had Africa been more isolated from
contact with the rest of the world, and cut off from
the immigration of the Arab and the European,
the purely Negroid races, left to themselves, so far
from advancing towards a higher type of humanity,
might have actually reverted by degrees to a
type no longer human.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, G. Stanley Hall says that
our intercourse with the African races “had been
a curse and not a blessing. Our own Indians are
men of the Stone Age whom Bishop Whipple
thought originally the noblest men on earth.
Look at them now!”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>Up to a short time ago men of authority asserted
that marriage had sprung up from a “state of
promiscuity,” the believers in this theory forgetting
that even “among animals the most akin to
man, this state of promiscuity is rather exceptional.”</p>

<p>Most of the people cited as following this practice
have been shown to have individual marriage to
the exclusion of other forms. Undoubtedly in
many cases what are called group marriages have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
been mistaken for promiscuity. Almost equally
low in the social scale is polyandry, where one
woman may have several husbands.</p>

<p>Whatever the origin of marriage, the fact is,
however, that the idea of marriage comes after
the idea of the child—as in the animal world, the
family is established for the purpose of taking
care of the children that have been brought into
the world.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>In <i>Mahabharata</i>, the Indian poem, we are told
that marriage was founded by Swetaketu, son of
the Rishi Uddalaka; according to the Chinese
annals, the Emperor Fou-hi established the
custom; the Egyptians ascribed its introduction
to Menes, and the Greeks to Kekrops. Nowhere
is it assumed as a condition of the race of all time.
Its origin, growth, and development are really the
origin, growth, and development of the idea of
protecting human offspring.</p>

<p>A convincing scientific explanation of marriage,
however, has been set forth by Westermarck.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
Among the great sub-kingdom of the Invertebrata
not even the female parent exhibits any anxiety
about the offspring. The heat of the sun hatches
the eggs of the highest order, the insects, and in
most cases the mother does not even see her young.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>Parental care is rare among the lowest vertebrata.
Among fishes the young are generally
hatched without the assistance of the parents.
There are exceptions to this among the Teleostei,
where the male assumes the usual maternal functions
of constructing a nest and jealously guarding
the ova deposited there by the female. The
male of certain species of the Arius, carries the
ova in his pharynx. Nearly all of the reptiles,
having placed their eggs in a convenient sunny
spot, pay no more attention to them.</p>

<p>With few exceptions, the relations of the sexes
of the lower vertebrata can be described as fickle;
they meet in the pairing time, part again, and have
little more to do with one another.</p>

<p>“The Chelonia form,” says Westermarck, “with
regard to their domestic habits, transition to the
birds, as they do also from a zoölogical and particularly
from an embryological point of view.”
He then goes on to show that parental affection
in the latter class, not only on the side of the
mother but on that of the father, has come to high
development. Members of the two sexes aid
each other in nest-building, the females bringing
the materials and the males doing the work. Other
duties which come with the mating season are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>shared by both, the mother being concerned with
incubation and the father aiding her by taking
her position when she leaves the nest for intervals,
providing her with food which he gathers, and
protecting her from dangers. When the breeding
season is over and the young have come, a new
set of duties is evolved. Young birds are not left
alone by their parents, absences being necessitated
only by searches for food for all members of the
nest. When dangers threaten the nest both
father and mother defend it bravely.</p>

<div class="caption">FAMILY LIFE AMONG BIRDS. GROUP OF AMERICAN EGRET

<small>(COURTESY OF MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, NEW YORK)</small></div>
</div>

<p>All efforts are made to have the young shift for
themselves as soon as they have grown strong
enough to make it feasible. Independence and
self-dependence come only after they are in all
ways capable of meeting their needs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are some species whose
young, from the beginning of their ultra-oval
existence, require and receive no care from the
parents. The duck is one of a species which leaves
all parental care to the female. In general it may
be said that both parents share the parental duties,
the chief duties, such as hatching and rearing of
the young, falling to the mother, while the father
gathers food and keeps off enemies.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>The relations of the two sexes are, therefore,
very intimate, and association lasts even after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
breeding season has passed. And only the birds
of the Gallinaceous family are an exception to the
rule of making such association permanent once it
has been started, death alone ending it.</p>

<p>Real marriage is to be found only among birds.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
For mammals the same cannot be said, for though
the mother generally gives much attention to the
young, the father does not always have as much
concern. He even, in some cases, is the enemy of
his own offspring. Yet even in the cases of mammals
there are durable associations between the
sexes. Very often these last only during the
rutting season, but among whales, seals, hippopotami,
the <i>Cervus campestris</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> gazelles,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> the
<i>Neotragus Hemprichii</i> and other small antelopes,
reindeer, the <i>Hydromus coypus</i>, squirrels, moles, the
ichneumon, and certain carnivorous animals,
among the latter cats, martens, the yaguarundi
of South America, and the <i>Canis Brasiliensis</i> and
perhaps the wolf, there are durable matings. Association
between the sexes is common among all
of these animals for periods after the young have
been born. And in all cases the male is the
family’s protector.</p>

<p>What is an exception among the lower mammals
is, however, a rule among the Quadrumana. According
to the natives of Madagascar some species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
of Prosimii are nursed by both male and female
in common. Among the <i>Arctopitheci</i> the female
is always assisted by the male in taking care of
the young.</p>

<p>Coming to the man-like apes, we are told by
Lieutenant de Crespigny that “in the northern
part of Borneo they live in families—the male,
female, and young one. On one occasion,” he
says, “I found a family in which were two young
ones, one of them much larger than the other,
and I took this as a proof that the family tie had
existed for at least two seasons. They build
commodious nests in the trees which form their
feeding-ground, and, so far as I could observe, the
nests, which are well lined with dry leaves, are
occupied only by the female and young, the male
passing the night in the fork of the same or another
tree in the vicinity. The nests are very numerous
all over the forest, for they are not occupied above
a few nights, the mias (or orang-utan) leading a
roving life.”</p>

<p>Dr. Savage says that the gorillas live in bands
and that but one male is seen in every band. M.
du Chaillu says that the male gorilla is always
accompanied by the female.</p>

<p>It is among the Negritians of Africa that we
find today the at-hand evidence of the attitude
of man toward his progeny in the first stages of
culture, or perhaps the last stages of savagery.
It must be remembered that in Africa, however,
habits of other races will be found grafted on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
negro stock, thereby causing them to appear sometimes
unusually gentle or again unusually advanced.
In Africa the Semitic and the Hamitic
grafts on negro stock provide many varieties of
mankind, just as in Oceania, the Mongol (Malay)
and the Caucasian (Indonesian) grafts on the
negro stock have produced many varieties there.
As an example of the methods of the lowest of
savage tribes, there is, however, no better example
than the Papuans of New Guinea of whom
the ethnologist, Keane, says: “They stand in
some respects on the lowest rung of the social
ladder.”</p>

<p>As an example of the low state of culture in
which part of them exist it is said that those near
Astrolabe Bay on the north-west coast of New
Guinea had no knowledge of the metals, all their
implements being of stone, wood, or bones; neither
had they knowledge of fire, the grandfathers of
the present generation being able to recall the
time when they had no fire at all, but ate their
food raw. In the study of these people we are
studying contemporaries of our own neolithic
ancestors.</p>

<p>According to their most popular myth, a crocodile
named Nugu was responsible for the frequent
disappearance of children until the tribe made an
agreement to supply him with pig’s fat instead.
Here we have the beginning of the theory of
sacrifice.</p>

<p>“In their treatment of children they are often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>violent and cruel,” says Alfred Russell Wallace,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
and an example of their idea of kindness may be
gathered from the following description of the
“ornamentation” of a young Papuan:</p>

<p>“The faces of both men and women are frequently
ornamented all over with cicatrices either
circular or chevron-shaped. The operation is a
painful and costly one, as the professional tattooer
has to be highly paid for his trouble, and not every
child’s friends can afford the fee demanded. The
instrument used is the claw of the flying-fox.
The unfortunate patient is not allowed to sleep
for two or three nights before the operation is
performed, and then, when he is ready to drop from
weariness, the tattooer begins his work, and completes
it at one sitting. I never saw the actual
process, but a child was brought for my inspection
whose face had just been finished off. It was in a
painful state of nervous irritation, and the face
swelled to an enormous size.”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>Of the condition of these people no one is better
able to speak than Lieutenant Governor J. H. P.
Murray,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> who describes tribes where the savages
have only weapons of wood, know nothing of the
bow and arrow, and are noted for their immorality.</p>

<p>“It is very often the case that the best of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
young girls are sold by their parents as courtesans,
the native name being Jelibo. I came across men
married, and possessing, in addition, these women.
Young fellows, not having reached puberty, had
clubbed together in parties of three and four, and
bought young girls from the parents to make
courtesans. At feasts, these girls are used for
the purpose of enriching themselves and their
owners.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>As to the attitude of the children, we gain some
idea of the aboriginal point of view by this statement:</p>

<p>“There are some villages in which children
absolutely swarm, but there are few large families;
practically every one is married, but there are
many couples who have no children, or only one
or two. In many parts of the territory it is considered
a disgrace for a woman to have a child
until she has been married at least two years;
infanticide and abortion, though rarely proved,
are said to be common, and a medical expert would
probably discover the existence of other checks
to population. The result of all this is that in
some districts the population is increasing while
in others it is not; such investigations as we have
been able to make lead, in the absence of definite
statistics, to the conclusion that the population
in that part of the territory which is under control
is certainly not diminishing, though the increase,
if any, is probably very small. The reason why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
the population does not increase as one would
expect now that village warfare has ceased is, as
far as I can see, simply that neither men nor women
want children, which I take to be the chief cause
that limits population elsewhere. The reason
why they do not want them is, I think, partly
because they find them a nuisance (which is a
consideration that was probably effective even
before the white man came) and partly that, in
their present state of transition from one stage
of development to another, they do not exactly
see what there will be for their children to do.”</p>

<p>Another custom of these people is to bury children
alive, when the parents or some person of
importance dies; the excuse given for this practice
is that the child will be needed to wait on the
parent in the other world, a practice that lasted
long among the civilized Egyptians.</p>

<p>Cannibalism is rife among these people. Mr.
Murray reports that on one occasion a young man
was brought before him for having murdered a
man in order to please a married woman with whom
he was in love—a lover who has not “killed his
man” being considered lukewarm.</p>

<p>“On my remonstrating with him on the impropriety
of paying attention to a married woman he
informed me that there were no girls in the village,
as they had all been killed and eaten in a recent
raid. The position of a young man who found
himself in a village where all the women were
either married or eaten was no doubt a difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
one, and I hope that I took it into consideration
in passing sentence.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>How little is the feeling among these people
over the murder of children, is shown from the
fact that murder is the only outlet for their feelings!</p>

<p>“I have known cases where a man, grieving
over the loss of a relative or over some slight that
has been put upon him, has set fire to his house,
quite regardless of whether any one was inside,
with the result, occasionally, that a child is burnt
to death, and I recently tried a case of murder
which was the direct outcome of grief over the
death of a pig. The prisoners were brothers, and
their pig bore the pretty name of Mehboma; but
Mehboma died, and the brothers in their unquenchable
grief went forth and killed the first
man they saw. The victim had nothing to do
with Mehboma’s death, but the mourning brothers
did not care for that—somebody had got to be
killed over it. The prisoners told me that it was
the custom of the village to show their grief in this
way, so that their neighbours must occasionally
have suffered rather severely.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>As the Australians are closely allied to the Papuans
and represent about the same period of culture,
we may postulate their attitude toward
woman and a marriage from the description of an
early Victorian tribe-marriage given by Brough
Smith and quoted by A. H. Keane, the latter au<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>thor
remarking that “a common test of a people’s
culture is the treatment of their women, and in
this respect the Australians must, as Prof. R.
Semon shows, be ranked below the Bushman and
on a level with the Fuegians.”</p>

</div>

<p>“A man having a daughter of thirteen or fourteen
years of age,” says Mr. Smith in his description
of the marriage customs in vogue among the
Victorian tribes, “arranges with some elderly
person for the disposal of her; and, when all are
agreed, she is brought out and told that her
husband wants her. Perhaps she has never seen
him but to loathe him. The father carries a spear
and a waddy, or tomahawk, and, anticipating
resistance, is thus prepared for it. The poor girl,
sobbing and sighing, and muttering words of
complaint, claims pity from those who will show
none. If she resists the mandates of her father,
he strikes her with his spear; if she rebels and
screams, the blows are repeated; and if she attempts
to run away, a stroke on the head from the
waddy or tomahawk quiets her. The mother
screams and scolds and beats the ground with her
<i>kan-nan</i> (fighting-stick); the dogs bark and whine;
but nothing interrupts the father, who, in the
performance of his duty, is strict and mindful of
the necessity of not only enforcing his authority,
but of showing to all that he has the means to
enforce it. Seizing the bride by her long hair he
drags her to the home prepared for her by her new
owner. Further resistance often subjects her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
brutal treatment. If she attempts to abscond,
the bridegroom does not hesitate to strike her
savagely on the head with his waddy, and the
bridal screams and yells make the night hideous.”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>THE KILLING OF TWINS—OTHER EXCUSES FOR INFANTICIDE—RESTRICTING
THE FAMILY—ECONOMIC
REASONS ACKNOWLEDGED—DYING OF DESPAIR.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T has seemed necessary to dwell thus at length
on the conditions among the Papuans and
allied tribes as it appeared to me important
that the very beginnings of the family should be
understood. The general agreement of ethnologists
as to the low standing of the Papuans justifies,
I believe, our assuming them to be as near the point
of culture of our neolithic (or paleolithic) ancestors
as it is possible to come.</p>

<p>From now on the course is upward. Strange
as it may seem, the lowest tribes are less “human,”
both in the matter of offspring and in the matter
of sentiment of love for women, than some of the
beasts and birds,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> but having touched that depth,
the next step brings us in contact with feelings
that, in a way, begin to approximate our own.</p>

<p>In the stages above the Papuans there is some
affection for the woman; her position is nearer to
that of wife and less that of captive. In consequence
there is a more kindly regard for the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>ren
that she bears. Now begins the development of
the parental <i>affection</i>. It is, however, confined to
the female at first; “to this fact, rather than to
doubt of paternity, should we attribute the very
common habit in such communities of reckoning
ancestry in the female line only.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>Man, no longer relying on his own cannibalistic
brute force to do with his progeny as he wishes,
invents reasons for doing away with his burdensome
offspring.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the Papuans restricted
their families to two children, when it
was possible. As late as the middle of the seventeenth
century, Dapper reported that in Benin
no twins were found, as it was regarded as a sign
of dishonour for a woman to have twins.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>Among the Arunta tribes in Central Australia,
twins are “immediately killed as something which
is unnatural.”<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Among northern tribes they
“are usually destroyed as something uncanny.”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
With the Kaffirs, it was found that “when twins
are born, one is usually neglected and allowed to
die.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Of the western Victorian tribes we learn
that “twins are as common among them as among
Europeans; but as food is occasionally very scarce
and a large family troublesome to move about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
it is lawful and customary to destroy the weaker
twin child, irrespective of sex.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>In some parts of the Benin territory, according
to a contemporary of Dapper, the twin-bearing
women are treated very badly.</p>

<p>According to Nyendael, they actually kill both
mother and infants, and sacrifice them to a certain
devil, which they fondly imagine harbours in a
wood near the village. “But if,” says this authority,
“the man happens to be more than ordinarily
tender, he generally buys off his wife, by sacrificing
a female slave in her place; but the children are
without possibility of redemption obliged to be
made the satisfactory offerings which this savage
law requires. In the year 1699, a merchant’s
wife, commonly called <i>ellaroe</i> or <i>mof</i>, lay-in of two
children, and her husband redeemed her with a
slave, but sacrificed his children. After which I
had frequent opportunities of seeing and talking
with the disconsolate mother, who never could see
an infant without a very melancholy reflection
on the fate of her own, which always extorted
briny tears from her. The following year the like
event happened to a priest’s wife. She was delivered
of two children, which, with a slave, instead
of his wife, he was obliged to kill and sacrifice with
his own hands, by reason of his sacerdotal function;
and exactly one year after, as though it had been
a punishment inflicted from heaven, the same
woman was the second time delivered of two child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>ren,
but how the priest managed himself on this
occasion I have not been informed, but am apt to
think that this poor woman was forced to atone
for her fertility by death. These dismal events
have in process of time made such impressions on
men, that when the time of their wives’ delivery
approaches, they send them to another country;
which makes me believe that for the future they
will correct these inhumanities.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>On the west coast of Africa “twins are killed
among all the Niger Delta tribes, and in districts
out of English control the mother is killed too,”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>
which shows the fanatic point to which a belief,
or rather an excuse, founded on the economic desire
to keep down the size of a family, may be carried.</p>

<p>All Kaffir children are neglected, according to
Kidd,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> but on the birth of twins, “one frequently
is killed by the father, for the natives think that
unless the father places a lump of earth in the
mouth of one of the babies, he will lose his
strength.”</p>

<p>The next provision to keep down the “cost of
living” is directed against children with blemishes,
a practice that was not easy to check even among
civilized peoples. Among the Australian aborigines
“it is usual to destroy those that are malformed.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Among certain tribes on the west coast, children
whose mothers have died are thrown into the
bush, “as are all children who have not arrived in
this world in the way considered orthodox or who
cut their teeth in an improper way.” A child
born with teeth is put to death, in some parts of
Africa; children born in stormy weather are
destroyed in Kamchatka.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> In Madagascar “the
superstition of lucky and unlucky days prevailed
throughout all the tribes, and the unfortunate
infants that came into the world on one of these
unlucky days were immediately destroyed.”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>How obvious are the so-called reasons for killing
the children may be seen from the fact that according
to another authority, the proscribed or unlucky
periods and days include all children born
in March and April, or in the last week of each
month, or on Wednesdays and Fridays.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> Among
the Antankarana tribes of the Amber Mountains
in Madagascar, a child that sneezes at or shortly
after its birth is exposed. Among the Basuto,
when a child is born with its feet first, it is killed,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
whereas among the Bondei it is killed if it is born
head first.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Among the Bondei, the excuses found for killing
children are many. If the child is born head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
first, it is a <i>kigego</i> (unlucky child) and is strangled;
if it cries, it is a <i>kigego</i> and is strangled. If the
father has not been in the <i>galo</i> (kekutoigwa), or
the mother has not been in the <i>kiwanga</i> (kekuviniwa)
(initiated), the child is a <i>tumbwi</i> (offence)
and is strangled.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>Mental processes the world over are much the
same. The American legislator raising the tariff
to keep out competitors is not employing a system
entirely dissimilar from that of the barbarians
who, finding the first proscriptions fail to keep
down the birthrate, widen the scope of the proscription.
And so the customary law grows to
include female children among the proscribed.
Writing in the latter part of the eighteenth century,
Don Felix de Azara declared he had found
that among the Guanas in South America it was
the custom for the women to bury alive the majority
of the female children, and that they never
brought up more than one boy and one girl.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>Rude attempts to regulate the number of
children next appeared. It has been suggested
that this phase of primitive development argues
mentality sufficient to foresee destruction of the
tribe that does not provide for the future. Doubtless,
in the mind of some savage Malthus, the
idea that the tribe must allow at least a given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
number of children to live, was conceived with
the warm glow of discovery.</p>

<p>Among the Tokelaus, or Line Islanders, “no
married pair are allowed by their law to have or
bear more than four children; that is, only four
get the chance of life. The woman has a right
to rear, or endeavour to rear, one child. It rests
with the husband to decide how many more shall
live, and this depends on how much land there is
to divide.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>On Radack Island a woman “is allowed to bring
up only three children; her fourth and every succeeding
one she is obliged to bury alive herself.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>Two boys and one girl were all that the Australian
mother brought up, according to Curr, although
the women bore an average of six children.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>Economic ingenuity—and trepidity—could go
no further than the practice in the Solomon Islands,
where “a small portion of the Ugi natives
have been born on the island, three-fourths of them
having been brought as youths to supply the place
of offspring killed in infancy. When a man needs
support in his declining years, his props are not
his own sons, but youths obtained by purchases
from the St. Christoval natives.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> Another
author says of the same islands that when “it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
becomes necessary to buy other children from other
tribes good care is taken not to buy them too
young.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>At Vaitupu, of the Ellice Islands, “only two
children are allowed to a family, as they are afraid
of a scarcity of food.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> It is on these coral islands
that Robert Louis Stevenson says the fear of
famine is greatest. He bears out the statement
that only two children were allowed to a marriage
on Vaitupu Island, and adds that on Nukufetu
only one child was permitted; “on the latter the
punishment was by fine, and it is related that the
fine was sometimes paid and the child spared.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>In the Dieyerie tribe, of Australia, “thirty per
cent. are murdered by their mothers at their birth,
simply for the reasons—firstly, that many of them,
marrying very young, their first-born is considered
immature and not worth preserving; and secondly,
because they do not wish to be at the trouble of
rearing them, especially if weakly. Indeed all
sickly and deformed children are made away with
in fear of their becoming a burthen to the tribe.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>With the coming of ritual, man assumes to
pacify his voracious deities by the sacrifices of
children, thereby propitiating the gods and reducing
the economic burden. The people of the Sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>jero
offer up their “first-born sons as sacrifices,
because, once upon a time, when summer and
winter were jumbled together in bad season, and
the fruits of the field would not ripen, the sooth-sayers
enjoined it.”<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>After telling an almost unprintable tale, Dr.
Brinton says of the Australian blacks that “among
several tribes it was an established custom for
a mother to kill and eat her first child, as it
was believed to strengthen her for later births.</p>

<p>“In the Luritcha tribe, young children are
sometimes killed and eaten, and it is not an infrequent
custom, when a child is in weak health, to
kill a younger and healthy one and then to feed
the weakling on its flesh, the idea being that this
will give to the weak child the strength of the
stronger one.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>Frank admission that the children are in the
way and are a burden, may be regarded either as
a sign that the tribe has progressed, or that it has
not yet reached the point of shame where it
cloaks the evil practice under the guise of religious
sacrifices, hygienic or customary regulations.</p>

<p>In this regard it is not possible to say that the
father, as opposed to the mother, is more inclined
to do away with offspring, or is more frequently
entrusted with that grewsome duty, although I
would venture to say that an exhaustive research<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
on this one aspect of the study would probably
show that the mother at first opposed and gradually
accepted, under the force of man’s will, the
idea that the destruction of her offspring was good;
first for herself and her lord and master, and
secondly for the tribe.</p>

<p>Should investigation uphold such an hypothesis,
it would be easily understood how the frank
acknowledgment represented an advanced stage,
when the woman, no longer satisfied with the
various trivial excuses offered for the destruction
of her young, insisted on keeping them alive, and
was met with, not the many invented reasons
that we have seen, but the plain truth, that their
continued existence endangered the food supply.</p>

<p>“Urgent want and sterility of the niggardly
earth” were the reasons given by the natives of
the island of Radnack for the law limiting the
number of children.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> A second child is killed
among the natives of Central Australia “only
when the mother is, or thinks she is, unable to
rear it”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> and yet the same authors say that “an
Australian native never looks far enough ahead
to consider what will be the effect on the food
supply in future years, if he allows a particular
child to live; what affects him is simply the question
of how it will interfere with the work of his
wife so far as their own camp is concerned; while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
from the woman’s side, the question is, can she
provide food enough for the new-born infant and
the next youngest?”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>The long suckling time, that these authors and
other travellers have noted, and that is here given
as a reason, as <i>opposed</i> to the economic one, for
the frequent killing of children, is due “chiefly
to want of soft food and animal milk”.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>Among the members of the Areoi society, a
peculiar and somewhat “secret” society<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> of the
islands of the Pacific, “a man with three or four
children, and this was a rare occurrence, was said
to be a <i>taata taubuubuu</i>, a man with an unwieldy
or cumbrous burden; and there is reason to believe
that, simply to avoid the trifling care and effort
necessary to provide for their offspring during the
helpless period of infancy and childhood, multitudes
were consigned to an untimely grave.” A
Malthusian motive has sometimes been adduced,
and the natives have been heard to say, that if all
the children born were allowed to live, there would
not be food enough produced in the islands to
support them.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>From many authorities comes direct evidence
of a clash between the man and the woman in the
Polynesian Islands. “As the burden of the plantation
and other work devolves on the woman, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
thinks that she cannot attend to more than two or
three children, and the rest must be buried as soon
as they are born. There are exceptions to this
want of maternal affection. At times the husband
urges the thing contrary to the wishes of the wife.
If he thinks the infant will interfere with her
work, he forcibly takes the little innocent and
buries it, and she, poor woman, cries for months
after her child.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>Among the nomadic tribes it is frankly admitted
that the children are a hindrance. The Lenguas,
of the Paraguayan Chaco, make journeys of from
ten to twenty miles, the women doing most of
the hard work. The consequence is that children
are not desirable. So with the Abipones, of whom
Charlevoix says: “They seldom rear but one child
of each sex, murdering the rest as fast as they come
into the world, till the eldest are strong enough to
walk alone. They think to justify this cruelty
by saying that, as they are almost constantly
travelling from one place to another, it is impossible
for them to take care of more infants than
two at a time; one to be carried by the father, and
the other by the mother.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>The explanation offered by the Kurnai was that
“it was often difficult to carry about young children,
particularly where there were several. Their
wandering life rendered this very difficult.”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>the struggle with nature, man descends as well as
ascends. The unfavourable conditions into which
nomadic tribes frequently come produce not
infrequently, a perverted type that is lower than
the animals to which our semi-human progenitors
of the extremely remote past belonged. “The
instincts of the lower animals,” says Darwin, “are
never so perverted as to lead them to regularly
destroy their own offspring or to be quite devoid of
jealousy.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>In parts of New South Wales, such as Bathurst,
Goulburn, and the Lachlan, or Macquarie, “it was
customary long ago for the first-born of every
lubra to be eaten by the tribe, as part of a religious
ceremony; and I recollect,” says J. M. Davis, “a
black fellow who had, in compliance with the
custom, been thrown when an infant on the fire,
but was rescued and brought up by some stock-keepers
who happened accidentally to be passing
at the time.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>Ellis declares that among the Marquesans who
inhabit a group of islands to the south-east of
Hawaii, children are sometimes, during “seasons
of extreme scarcity, killed and eaten by their
parents to satisfy hunger.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>It has been said that the social, moral, and intellectual
condition of woman indicates, in an ascending
scale, the degree of civilization of every tribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
and nation. It might with equal force be said
that the attitude of the tribe or nation toward its
young is also a barometer of progress. Behind
the harsh measure and savage customs, underneath
the cruelty and at times ferocious indifference
to pain, there is in general among the lowest
of the tribes an affection for their young, once it
has been decided that they are allowed to live.</p>

<p>In that too frequently suppressed affection,
stunted as it is by customary law and the unequal
struggle with nature, there is the beginning of
humanitarian progress. Given reasonable security
that there will be a sufficiency of food supply
and a surcease of neighbourhood wars, this affection
will pass from precept to concept and protect
even the unborn.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>“No people in the world are so fond of, or so
long-suffering with, children,” Stevenson says of
the same South Sea Islanders among whom he has
just said infanticide is common.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> But even after
it has been decided to bring up the child, and it
has become an object of great affection, it is still in
danger should famine conditions seem imminent,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
or should the cupidity and avarice of the parents
be aroused, with the consequence that children
are readily sold into slavery.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>Nature’s methods are stern, and her progress
slow; despite perplexing examples of reactionary
forces, the primitive move is steadily toward an
understanding of one’s duties as a human being—or
he dies. For the civilized man, pain is nature’s
warning that he has violated the rules of his own
body, and for the primitive man, decay and despair
are the warnings that the path of progress lies
the other way.</p>

<p>Looking over this vast field, including not only
blacks, Mongols, and Indians, but even the Europeans,
as we shall come to see later, we gather that
those that have struggled upward have been only
those who have taken nature’s lesson of lessons
to themselves. Horrible as is the story of these
stationary and degenerate peoples that we get,
what must be the whole story, with its full picture
of anguish?</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>SSUMING that the human cradle was in the
Eastern Archipelago, and more particularly
in the Island of Java where Dr.
Dubois discovered his <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>,
the primeval home of the Mongolian division of
the human race was the Tibetan plateau. From
this central plateau the early Mongol groups spread
during the Stone Age over the Asiatic continent,
in one place developing into the Akkado-Sumerians
of Babylonia, the almost extinct Hyperboreans
of Siberia in another, the Mongolo-Tartars stretching
across Central Asia from Japan to Europe,
the Tibeto-Indo-Chinese of Tibet, Indo-China,
and China, and the Oceanic Mongols of Malaysia,
Madagascar, and the Philippines.</p>

<p>In Tibet even today, polyandrous customs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
still strong and the nomadic tendencies of the
people show that the years of civilization or near-civilization
have not changed the primitive roving
inclinations, inclinations that partly account for
the indifference to child life among the Chinese.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of ancient China rests principally
on two authorities, the <i>Chou King</i> of
Confucius, written 484 <span class="smcap lowercase lowercase">B. C.</span>, and the <i>Sse Ki</i> of Tsse
Ma Thsein, written at the beginning of the first
era before Christ. Confucius was not able to go
further back than seventeen centuries before his
own time, so that we can safely say that we know
something about Chinese history for about 2200
years before the Christian era. The social and
political life of the Chinese people in the time of
Yao, the first of the emperors named by Confucius,
was that of a pastoral people, but even then most
of the useful arts had been invented, writing was
already known, and the first notions of astronomy
on which they founded their calendar had been
acquired. The successor of Yao was Chun, and
after Chun came Hia, the founder of a dynasty
which lasted from 2205 to 1767 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, with which
dynasty began the real history of China.</p>

<p>When Confucius appeared the Chinese Empire
was a highly civilized nation, but of Confucius
it has been said that he, more than any other one
man, went to make China a nation. Born at a
time when his country was torn with discord and
desolated by war, husbandry neglected, peace of
households destroyed, and plunder and rapine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
common occurrences, Confucius was nineteen when
he married and added to the national woes his
own domestic troubles, divorcing the lady after a
brief period in captivity, but not however until
she had borne him a son.</p>

<p>It is through this son that we learn something
of the personal character of Confucius. An inquisitive
disciple asked the son if he had learned
any more than those who were not related to the
great teacher.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Le. “He was standing alone
once when I was passing through the court below
with hasty steps, and said to me:</p>

<p>“‘Have you read the Odes?’</p>

<p>“On my replying, ‘Not yet,’ he added:</p>

<p>“‘If you do not learn the Odes, you will not
be fit to converse with.’</p>

<p>“Another day in the same way and the same
place, he said to me:</p>

<p>“‘Have you read the rules of Propriety?’</p>

<p>“On my replying ‘Not yet,’ he added:</p>

<p>“‘If you do not learn the rules of Propriety,
your character cannot be established.’”</p>

<p>“I asked one thing,” said the enthusiastic disciple,
“and I have learned three things. I have
learned about the Odes, I have learned about the
rules of Propriety, and I have learned that the
Superior Man maintains a distant reserve toward
his son.”</p>

<p>In this anecdote—and in his works—it is evident
that Confucius had the Chinese estimate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
the child—the father was sovereign; the child,
as long as that sovereign lived, a mere subject.
It was this idea and the strongly implanted idea
of filial piety that led to the callous attitude
toward children among the disciples of Confucius.</p>

<p>The Chinese explanation and defence of this
phase of their life is that up to the year 232 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>
there did not exist in China anything but the most
humane system of treatment of children. The
Jesuit authors of the <i>Mémoires</i> declare that up
to that time there is no trace of the drowning of
infants, their abandonment, etc. Instead of being
a burden, says the missionary chronicler, children
were considered an asset and the orphan was generally
in the position of having to choose between
many would-be adoptive parents. The law is
cited to prove this, the Code declaring that in
case there were several people anxious to adopt
an orphan, preference should be given to those
who were childless.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>It was under Ts’in Chi Hoang,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> who reigned
about 232 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, that the abominable practice grew
up, along with many other ills. The greed and
avarice of the nobles and the Emperor’s immediate
following produced much suffering, in the wake
of which came famine, causing mothers and fathers
to abandon children that they were not able to
feed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever truth there may be in this statement,
there is very little doubt that the reign of Ts’in
Chi Hoang was one of bloodshed, war, and suffering
and that with the end of the Chou (or Chow),
dynasty, and the accession of the Prince Ts’in,
first as the dominating King and then as Emperor
of China, there was much suffering.</p>

<p>“It was a time of extreme severity,” says the
historian Tsse Ma Thsien, “and all affairs were
decided according to the law without either grace
or charity.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>In addition to his bloodthirsty qualities, the
Prince Ts’in, who was known as the Great First
Emperor and who insisted that all successors
should be known as the Second, Third, and Fourth
Emperors, was superbly egotistic. Everything,
including literature, was ordained to begin from
his reign, to which end he issued an edict that all
books should be burned. He put to death so
many hundred of the <i>literati</i> who refused to obey
this edict that the “melons actually grew in winter
on the spot beneath which the bodies were buried”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>—a
tribute to the fertile character of the Chinese
<i>literati</i>.</p>

<p>Even assuming that the ill-treatment of children
as we know it today did not extend farther
back than the period ascribed to it by the Catholic
missionaries, the period of Ts’in Chi Hoang, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
earliest records of the Chinese indicate that the
family was placed on a plane that, for severity
toward children, challenges even the Roman <i>patria
potestas</i>. To the Emperor Yao or Yau, who is
supposed to have reigned about 2300 years before
Christ, is ascribed the first step in establishing the
Chinese attitude toward parents and the respectful
obedience exacted from children. Particular
emphasis was laid on the son’s obedience. It was
apparently taken for granted that a daughter
would not be rebellious.</p>

<p>Having occupied the throne a long time, Yao,
as it is said, called his ministers about him and,
telling them that he had now reigned for more than
seventy years, expressed his willingness to abdicate
in favour of any one who felt capable of taking
the Emperor’s place. When no one volunteered—they
were wise Chinese—he asked them to suggest
someone who was deserving of charity.</p>

<p>“Yu Chun,” answered the ministers, “though
an aged man, is without a wife and comes from an
obscure family. Though his father was blind
and of neither talent nor mind, and his mother a
wicked woman by whom he was mistreated, and
though his brother Siang is full of pride, he has
observed the rules of filial obedience and has lived
in peace and has gradually improved the condition
of his family.”</p>

<p>“Then,” replied the Emperor, “I shall give
him my two daughters in marriage and he shall
succeed me on the throne to the exclusion of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
son, Ly, who has shown himself to be unworthy
by his lack of respect for his parents.”</p>

<p>And it was this Yu Chun, it is said, who further
established the Chinese principles of morality,
by which the family and not the individual shaped
the progress of the nation.</p>

<p>How well established those principles became
may be seen from the <i>Li Ki</i>, which was composed
about a thousand years later. This is a code or
book of ceremonials on the civil life, composed or
put together by or under the patronage of Tscheou
Kong, uncle of the Emperor Tchin Ouang, in
1145 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span></p>

<p>“A son,” says the <i>Li Ki</i>, “possesses nothing
while his parents are living. He cannot even
expose his life for a friend.”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>“A son has received his life from his father and
his mother,” says Confucius in the <i>Hiao King</i>,
composed 480 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, “and this gives them rights
over him that are above all others.”</p>

<p>In the legend of How Tseih, the founder of the
House of Chow, whose mother was Keang Yuen
and whose father was “a toe print made by God,”
the adventures of the child are thus described:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">He was placed in a narrow lane,</div>
<div class="line">But the sheep and oxen protected him with loving care.</div>
<div class="line">He was placed in a wide forest,</div>
<div class="line">Where he was met with by the wood-cutters.</div>
<div class="line">He was placed on the cold ice,</div>
<div class="line"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>And a bird screened and supported him with its wings.</div>
<div class="line">When the bird went away</div>
<div class="line">How Tseih began to wail.</div>
<div class="line">His cry was long and loud</div>
<div class="line">So that his voice filled the whole way.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>No indication is given in the ode as to who was
responsible for exposing the infant to these dangers,
but just as in other mythologies in which the heroes
or near-gods survive the dangers of infancy, there
is no doubt that this Chinese hero was pictured as
having overlived dangers that were the common
lot of the average child. The commentators take
different views of the person responsible for the
dangers to which How Tseih was subjected, Maou
believing that it was the father, the Emperor
K’uh; Ch’ing on the contrary holding that it was
Keang Yuen, the mother, who did it herself but
not for the purpose of getting rid of the child so
much as to show what a “marvellous gift he was
from Heaven.”<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>It is not that there are not occasional tender
strains in the ode. Number seven in the Odes
of Ts’e, the poet, sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">How young and tender</div>
<div class="line">Is the child with his two tufts of hair.</div>
<div class="line">When you see him after not so long a time</div>
<div class="line">Lo! He is wearing the cap.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>Writing later the Emperor Tai Tsong, the author
of a book called the <i>Mirror of Gold</i>, repeated these
ideas on ancestor worship in the following ordinance
(627 to 650 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>):</p>

<p>“The foundation of all the virtues is filial piety.
It is the first thing to learn and I in my youth have
received the right lessons. I have done my best
to place at ease all my subjects to the end that
the parents might be in a state to bring their
children up properly and that infants in their
turn might acquit themselves of their duties toward
their parents.</p>

<p>“When the virtue of filial piety flourishes, then
all other virtues will follow. In order that the
Empire may know that such is my desire and that
it is nearest to my heart, I now order that there
be distributed in my name and my account to all
those who are known for their filial piety, five
large measures of rice. To those who have passed
their eightieth year, two measures; to those of
ninety years, three measures; ... Moreover one
shall give, commencing with the first moon, to
each woman who gives birth to a son, a measure
of rice.”</p>

<p>But twice is there mention of human sacrifice
in the <i>Chu’un Ts’ew</i> but both references indicate
that there was little regard for honour as well as
for human life. In the account of the reign of
Duke He, who ruled from 658 to 626 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, it is
said that when the Viscount Tsang went to covenant
with the people of Choo, the Viscount was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
sacrificed as an animal might be sacrificed on an
altar built on the banks of the Suy in order that
the wild tribes of the East might be frightened
and “drawn toward him.”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>In the twelfth year of the reign of Duke Ch’aou,
who was Marquis of Loo from <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> 540 to 509, the
army of Ts’oo seized Yew (Yin) and sacrificed
him on Mount Kang.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>Not until the reign of Choen Tche (1633 to 1662
<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>) was there any movement to check the slaughter
of infants. Then it was found that infanticide
had desolated so many of the provinces that it
was necessary for this Emperor, the founder of
the Tsing dynasty, to condemn the crime and
warn the inhabitants of Hang Hoi, of Kiang Sou,
and of Fou-kien that the practice must stop.</p>

<p>The first official document endeavouring to save
the children was dated the second day of the
third moon, 1659, and was an appeal to the Emperor
by an under-official.</p>

<p>“The Supreme King,” it begins, “loves to give
life and to prevent destruction. All men have
received from Heaven a pitying heart. But the
corruption of morals comes between the father
and the child and causes men to be guilty of cruelty.
I, your humble subject, have learned that
in the provinces of Kiang Nan, Kiang Si, and Fou
Kien there exists the barbarous custom of drowning
little girls.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>The request of the official for an imperial edict
against the practice was approved by Choen Tche,
who condemned the murder of female children and
ordered the mandarins of the provinces named to
use means to check the practice. On the twenty-third
day of the third moon in the same year in
the presence of his advisers, he issued the following
edict:</p>

<p>“We had heard that there were people who
drowned their girl children but we had not been
able to believe it. Today our censor T’Kiai
having addressed to us a petition on this unholy
practice, we are led to believe that it must really
exist.</p>

<p>“The paternal emotions come from nature and
there ought not be any difference in the manner
of treating sons and daughters. Why should
parents conduct themselves cruelly toward girl
babies and condemn them to death? Meng Tse
has said:</p>

<p>“‘When one sees an infant on the point of
falling into a well every man feels in his heart the
sentiments of fear and compassion.’</p>

<p>“Here, however, it is not a question of strangers
or of passers-by. Since all men are moved at the
sight of an infant in danger when that infant is a
stranger, what kind of parents must those be who
deprive their own children of life? What excesses
are they not capable of when they can commit
such crimes?</p>

<div class="caption">SPECIAL REPOSITORY FOR BODIES OF NEGLECTED BABIES, CHINA<br />
<small>(REPRODUCED FROM “CHINA IN DECAY”)</small></div>
</div>

<p>“The Supreme Ruler loves to give life and wishes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>that all beings might enjoy themselves without
harm. But if a mother and father destroy the
child to which they have given life, how can they
help but see in that act a blot in the celestial
harmony?</p>

<p>“If flood and famine, war and pestilence, visit
their terrors on the people, it is because these misfortunes
are the punishments for the crimes spoken
of. The ancient Emperors wept bitterly over
these faults of the people and pardoned crimes,
and by that spirit imitated the Spirit of Heaven,
who loves to give life. When one of our officers
addresses us a report concerning a great wrong,
we first look to save the life; if it is not possible to
use clemency, and if it is necessary that we pronounce
the sentence of death, such a decision
causes us genuine sadness. How great ought to
be our sorrow, however, at the sight of an infant
that had hardly been born, condemned to death.</p>

<p>“Although the mandarins have prohibited this
custom, all people are probably not aware of the
prohibition. Measures must therefore be taken
to bring this prohibition to the knowledge of all
and an end must be put to this custom. Not
until then will we be joyous and content.</p>

<p>“Ho Long Tou in his book entitled <i>On Abstaining
from Drowning Little Girls</i> has written these
words:</p>

<p>“‘The Tiger and the Wolf are very cruel but
they understand the relations that should exist
between the parent and its offspring. Why then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
should man, gifted as is no animal, show himself
to be on a lower plane? Our infants, boys and
girls, are equally the fruit of our bodies. I have
heard that the sad cry uttered by these girl babies
as they are plunged into a vase of water and
drowned is inexpressible. Alas! that the heart
of a father or a mother should be so cruel.’”</p>

<p>Choen Tche then makes an appeal to his subjects
asking them not to tolerate further this barbarous
custom, dwelling on the superior and more gentle
quality of daughters over sons, citing historical
instances of the good fortune that many daughters
had brought to their parents, and concluding by
promising the benediction of Heaven on those who
would protect the lives of the little females.</p>

<p>Choen Tche (or Shun Chih) was the ninth son
of T’ien Ts’ung and was left to the care of his
uncle as regent. His reign was marked by an
endeavour to consolidate the newly acquired
empire. His biographers speak of his magnanimity
as a ruler and he was much praised by his
contemporaries. The fact that he treated the
Catholic missionaries with favour may also partially
explain his horror over the conditions of
which he was apparently ignorant until the
protest.</p>

<p>Choen Tche’s reign also marked the beginning
of many modern things in the history of China.
It was during his life that there took place the
first diplomatic intercourse between the government
of the Middle Kingdom and the European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
nations, both the Dutch and the Russians having
had an embassy resident at Pekin during 1656,
but although both were treated most politely,
neither achieved the substantial gains they sought.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>
It was during his reign too that tea was first introduced
to England and a substitute produced for
the quart of ale with which even Lady Jane Grey
washed down her morning bacon.</p>

<p>It was, however, under the reign of Kang Hi,
the son of Choen Tche, that the modern attitude
toward children was approximated. The great
works of Kang Hi and his long reign have obscured
the wisdom and moderation of Choen Tche. One
of Kang Hi’s first acts was to abolish for all time
the eunuchs, a law being passed and engraven on
metals that it might stand the ravages of time,
forbidding for all time the employment in public
service of this class of person, and the Manchus,
until the time they gave up the sceptre a few years
ago, held to their word. Thus passed out of
Chinese history its most industrious class of
trouble makers.</p>

<p>But two years after the death of Choen Tche,
a writer named Li Li Ong collected the edicts
that were being issued by mandarins to show
the spread of vice among the people. Among
this collection was the following addressed to the
governor of the province of Tche Kiang by the
mandarin, Ki Eul Jia, prefect of Yen Tcheou:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>“The Heaven and the Earth love to shower
benefits on man and to conserve life. But alas!
the inhabitants of this prefecture of Yen Tcheou
have the habit of drowning their girl babies. The
rich as well as the poor have been found to be
guilty of this crime. The tiger, despite his cruelty,
does not devour his young, and it is hard to think
that man should be insensible to the cries of his
drowning infant. I myself have witnessed such
drownings and that is why I ask that you send
into my six districts a proclamation strictly prohibiting
infanticide. It will be printed on stone.
If any one should then be guilty of the crime, his
neighbours should be encouraged to notify the
magistrates that he might be dealt with according
to law. As you are charged to maintain morality
among the people, I propose that you use this
means.”</p>

<p>Whether this suggestion was taken or not, it is
known that in that particular province infanticide
increased instead of diminished. The particularly
interesting part of this document is that it brings
to light the fact from an official source that the
rich as well as the poor were the offenders and
that it was not lack of food alone that made this
practice so common in China.</p>

<p>Even in modern times this is so, a midwife who
was asked in recent years to become a Christian
saying that it was impossible inasmuch as it interfered
with her business. She said that frequently
she was asked by wealthy people to drown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
the female children which the parents had not the
courage to kill themselves.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>In 1720 Father d’Entrcolles translated a manual
for the use of mandarins which bore the title <i>The
Perfect Happiness of the People</i> and which contained
a plan for a “House of Pity for homeless infants”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
and an exhortation to put such a plan into execution,
declaring that in times past there had been
such institutions for the reception of orphans
and homeless children and that nurses had been
provided for them when they had been rescued.</p>

<p>The next proclamation of which we have any
knowledge was that issued with the approval of
the Emperor Kien Long, who reigned from 1736
to 1796. In 1772, Ngeou Yang Yun Ki addressed
to the Emperor, in the thirty-seventh year and
the twenty-ninth day of the tenth moon of his
reign, a communication in which it was stated that
the poor families had been obliged to drown their
daughters because they had not had enough food.
Permission was asked to inflict on the person who
committed this crime, the penalty of sixty blows
from a cane, and a year in exile. In 1773 the
Emperor Kien Long himself issued the following
edict against infanticide:</p>

<p>“The statutes fixing the penalty for the murder
of a grown-up child or a small child presuppose
that the child has not failed to obey the orders
of its parents or grandparents, and cover cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
where the infants are murdered deliberately and
with premeditation. This crime, which violates
the laws of nature, should be punished with the
whip and with banishment. If the infants that
are thus killed are but newly-born and therefore
without intelligence and reason, the guilty cannot
plead the disobedience of these daughters as
an excuse for their crimes. Therefore henceforth
whenever any one following the barbarous custom
shall drown his infants, he will be prosecuted for
murder with premeditation, and when the proof
has been properly established before the proper
tribunals he will receive a sentence equal to that
which is meted out to the parents or grandparents
who voluntarily assassinate their children.
It is not necessary to issue a special ordinance.
Let all respect this decree.”</p>

<p>A dozen years later another voice was raised
in protest against the drowning of girls. Chen,
Treasurer General of the province of Kiang Sou,
presented to the governor of that province a proclamation
against infanticide and begged him to
publish it.</p>

<p>In 1815 a writer named Ou Sing King made an
appeal to the officials of China to stop the drowning
of infants and the sale of women, and this appeal
falling into the hands of the Emperor Kia King,
a proclamation was issued against both vices.
The writer, Ou Sing King, was given imperial
permission to go further in his investigations.</p>

<p>Early in the reign of Tao Kang (1820–1851)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
the then governor of the province of Tche Kiang,
believing that the expensive wedding gifts were
the real cause of the child murder, decreed:</p>

<p>“It is ordered that ornaments of gold, pearls,
precious stones, and embroidered gowns are forbidden
at all marriages. As for silver ornaments,
silks, and other materials, this is the rule that we
hereby establish:</p>

<p>“For rich families the sum set out for such
purchases must not be over one hundred taels.
For people of medium fortune the expense must
be limited to from forty to fifty taels. Those of
inferior blood must not spend more than twenty
or thirty taels and the poorest people must not
go beyond two or five.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>“As for gifts by the parents to the husband, the
quantity is left to their discretion; this being the
means to avoid all dispute. After the marriage,
on certain occasions, it is permitted to make one
or two presents. The celebrations of three and
seven days when the grandson is born or when he
attains his first year are hereby forbidden and
henceforth the people should not have any more
difficulties about bringing up daughters. If, in
spite of this, the poor are unable to bring up their
female children, they must carry them to the
orphanage or give them to other families.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>On the 19th of February, 1838, the Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
General Ki of the province of Koang Tong instituted
an investigation to find out what the actual
conditions were in his provinces, and after receiving
his reports, issued a proclamation in which he said:</p>

<p>“I am convinced that in the province of Koang
Tong the custom of drowning and suffocating the
girl babies is common and that the rich as well as
the poor are guilty. The poor pretend that, not
having sufficient means of existence, they are not
able to bring up their female children, while the
rich declare that there is no object in bringing up
children that occupy a purely ornamental position
in the household.”</p>

<p>Ki then goes on to philosophize on the enormity
of the crime and the folly of these reasons. Never,
perhaps, did any single individual in China devote
himself with more energy to trying to eradicate
this evil than did Ki, both by verbal castigation of
those who were guilty of the crime and by appealing
to the sympathies of the inhabitants of his
province. He distributed copies of the works of
Ouang Ouan. He sent out advice and instructions
to his subordinates that infanticide must be prevented;
he enlisted the nobles and educated people
in this fight and reiterated that those who were
guilty of the crime would be seized, judged, and
punished with sixty blows and a year’s banishment
as the law directed. Throughout the province
his efforts were regarded as extremely interesting,
his proclamations as delightful literature, and there
was no decrease in the number of murders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>In 1845 the Emperor Tao Kang himself published
an edict condemning the practice and declaring
that the extreme punishment permitted by
the law would be meted out to the guilty. The
edict had no effect.</p>

<p>In 1848 another endeavour was made by the
chief magistrate of Canton, acting on the initiative
of Ki, to eliminate the evil in that particular
city, but neither in Canton or in the province of
Koang Tong was there a cessation of the evil for
eighteen years afterward. The Emperor Kong Tche
listed both Canton and the province as among the
places where infanticide was most common.</p>

<p>During the reign of Hien Fong, 1851–1862, little
progress was made. In many parts of China during
the following reign, that of Tong Tche, 1862–1875,
attempts were made to check the evil.</p>

<p>During the minority of the Emperor the two
Empress Regents issued a proclamation in which
they appealed to the “nobles and rich of all villages
to contribute for the erection of orphanages
where there might be received abandoned children
so that the poor will not be able to justify their
abominable practice on the ground of poverty.”</p>

<p>The reign of Koang Siu began in 1875, and was
marked with vigorous proclamations and warnings
to the people to take their children to the orphan
asylums that were being established rather than
to throw them into the river.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>Of the conditions as they exist in modern times,
travellers and writers are of one accord—infanticide
is horribly prevalent. The conditions vary
with different localities.</p>

<p>“In Fuhkien province,” says Williams, “especially
in the department of Chang Chau, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>fanticide
prevails to a greater extent than in
any other part of the Empire yet examined. Mr.
Abeel extended his inquiries to forty different
towns and villages lying in the first, and found
that the percentage was between seventy and
eighty down to ten, giving an average of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
forty per cent. of all girls born in those places as
being murdered. In Chang Chau, out of seventeen
towns, the proportion lies between one fourth
and three tenths in some places, occasionally
rising to one third, and in others sinking to one
fifth, making an average of one fourth put to
death. In other departments of the province the
practice is confessed, but the proportion thought
by intelligent natives to be less, since there is less
poverty and fewer people than formerly.”</p>

<p>“Infanticide, which until now has gone unpunished,”
says Dr. Lauterer, “is practised especially
in Pekin and Fuhkien. A large per cent. of female
infants meet with an unnatural death because of
their parents’ poverty or their niggardliness. The
unfortunates are simply cast into the nearest
stream and the corpse left until the morning when
the government’s wagon collects them, or they are
exposed in the open where, not being protected
from the cold, they soon perish. Lately a decree
has been made to prohibit it.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>“The province of Fuhkien,” says Douglas, “is
that in which this crime most obtains. Inquiries
show that in many districts as large a portion as
one fourth of the female children born are destroyed
at birth. At Pekin, on the other hand, it cannot
be said to exist at all. But in this as in so many
social offences in China, the sword of the law, which
is alone capable of putting down crime, is allowed
to hang like a rusty weapon on the wall. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>true that occasionally proclamations are issued
in which the heinousness of the evil is explained
with all the impressiveness that could be desired,
but so long as natural affection finds no support
from without it will continue, in China, to yield
to the requirements of daily food.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>“The custom of infanticide,” wrote Professor
Krausse, “is one which has obtained in many parts
of China for ages. It does not, as a rule, take the
form of actual murder, but consists rather in assisting
the laws of Nature. Thus an infant will be
neglected and permitted to perish, or if it sicken,
will be put aside and allowed to take its chance.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>“Outside the wall [of Wie Hsien],” writes A. J.
Brown, “we saw a ‘Baby House,’ a small stone
building in which dead children of the poor are
thrown to be eaten by dogs!</p>

<p>“I wanted to examine it, but was warned not to
do so as the Chinese imagine that foreigners make
their medicine out of children’s eyes and brains,
and our crowds of watching Chinese might quickly
become an infuriated mob.”<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>In the face of all this one reads with interest in
a book by a professor of Chinese in the University
of Cambridge that:</p>

<p>“Among other atrocious libels which have
fastened upon the fair name of the Chinese people,
first and foremost stands the charge of female<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
infanticide, now happily, though still slowly,
fading from the calculations of those who seek
the truth.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

NEW-BORN TABOO—MYTH OF THE EXPOSURE OF
THE CHILD OF THE GODS—GROWTH OF THE MARRIAGE
CUSTOM—THE ARRIVAL OF THE CHINESE—MODERN

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE first inhabitants of Japan were a numerous
people named Koropok-guru, who
lived in conelike huts built over holes
dug in the earth and who were exterminated by
the Ainu people. The latter were in turn conquered
by the race that we speak of today as the
Japanese; these last settlers coming to the islands
of Japan from somewhere in the north of Central
Asia, while a second stream of South Asian
immigrants were drifted to Japan by the Japan
current.</p>

<p>In the <i>Kojiki</i>, or “Records of Ancient Matters,”
dictated by Hide-no-are and completed in <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>
711 or 712, we have a record of the mythology,
manners, language, and the traditional history
of Japan; this “history” purports to give the actual
story of Japan from the year 660 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, when
the first Emperor Jimmu, “having subdued and
pacified the savage deities and extirpated the un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>submissive
people, dwelt at the palace of Kashiwabara.”
Modern Japanese scholars as well as
Western scholars are inclined to say that there is
really no authentic history before <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 461 but as
a picture of the customs of early Japan, the <i>Kojiki</i>
is still the only authentic document that we have.</p>

<p>Inazo Nitobe, in dividing the history of his
country into periods, groups the legendary age
and all that went before the political reforms of
the seventh century as the first period, under the
name of the “ancient period.”</p>

<p>These ancient people, the mythical people of
the <i>Kojiki</i>, had passed through a genuine Bronze
Age and had in general attained a high level of
barbaric skill. Of their many curious customs, both
in the <i>Kojiki</i> and in the equally important <i>Nihongi</i>
or “Chronicles of Japan,” prominent notice
is made of the “parturition house”—“one-roomed
but without windows, which a woman was supposed
to build and retire into for the purpose of
being delivered unseen.” Here is evidence that the
infant was “taboo” until it had been received by
the head of the house.</p>

<p>Even up to recent times in the island of Hachijo
the custom survived according to Ernest
Satow, who visited this island in 1878.</p>

<p>“In Hachijo,” wrote Mr. Satow, “women, when
about to become mothers, were formerly driven
out to the huts on the mountainside, and according
to the accounts of native writers, left to shift
for themselves, the result not unfrequently being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
the death of the new-born infant, or if it survived
the rude circumstances under which it first saw the
light, the seeds of disease were sown which clung
to it throughout its after life. The rule of non-intercourse
was so strictly enforced that the
woman was not allowed to leave the hut even to
visit her own parents at the point of death, and
besides the injurious effects that this solitary
confinement must have had on the wives themselves,
their prolonged absence was a serious loss
to households where there were elder children and
large establishments to be superintended. The
rigour of the custom was so far relaxed in modern
times that the huts were no longer built on the
hills, but were constructed inside the homestead.
It was a subject of wonder to people from other
parts of Japan that the senseless practice should
still be kept up, and its abolition was often recommended,
but the administration of the Shoguns
was not animated by a reforming spirit, and it
remained for the government of the Mikado to
exhort the islanders to abandon this and the previously
mentioned custom. They are therefore
no longer sanctioned by official authority and the
force of social opinion against them is increasing,
so that before long these relics of ancient ceremonial
religion will in all probability have disappeared
from the group of islands.”</p>

<p>As with most early histories there is little description
of custom or manners in either the <i>Kojiki</i>
or the <i>Nihongi</i>, but we gather what the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
attitude was toward children from the fact that
the conception of marriage was probably limited
to cohabitation, this condition lasting until well
on into the Middle Ages,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> cohabitation being often
secret at first, but afterward acknowledged.
When the latter conditions had come to prevail,
the young man, instead of going to his mistress
under the cover of the night, brought her back
publicly to his parents’ home, and that was the
beginning of his own home.</p>

<p>Little is there in the <i>Kojiki</i> about the care of
children but the harshness toward women about to
have children, as shown in the frequent reference
to the parturition houses, shows that unless they
were children of royalty they were left to whatever
care their mothers might be able to bestow
on them.</p>

<p>In the account of the making of Japan by the
two Heavenly Deities, known as the Izani-gi-no-kami
and Izana-mi-no-kami, the Man Who Invites
and the Female Who Invites, it is stated
that their first child was not retained.</p>

<p>“This child,” says the legend,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> after retailing
the events that led up to its birth, “they placed
in a boat of reeds and let it float away. Next they
gave birth to the island of Aha. This is not reckoned
among their children.”</p>

<p>Among the gods, therefore, children were rejected
or accepted without ceremony, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
such an attitude of rejection or acceptance depicted
as the normal condition among the deities,
it may easily be imagined what was the attitude
of the ordinary beings who modelled their conduct
on that of the deities.</p>

<p>It is told of the first Emperor Jimmu, that,
meeting a group of seven maidens, he invited one
of them to become a wife of his, and on her acceptance
the sovereign passed the night at her house.
This constituted the only marriage ceremony that
the times knew. As far as the woman was concerned,
all that the new condition meant was that
she was liable to receive a visit at any time from
her new lord and master, but on his side there
was no obligation, no duty of fidelity, and he was
free to form as many similar unions as fancy
dictated.</p>

<p>The children were brought up by the mother
and one household of a man might be in absolute
ignorance of another.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> Mistress, wife, and concubine
were on the same footing and could be
discarded at any moment. When the Deity of
Eight Thousand Spears, attired in his favourite
courting costume, is about to go forth and search
for a “better wife” he boldly announces that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">When I take and attire myself so</div>
<div class="line">Carefully in my august garments green</div>
<div class="line">As the kingfisher—</div>
<div class="line">It is with the intention of finding another mate.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>To this the Chief Empress, Her Augustness the
Forward Princess, to whom the frank statement
is made, plaintively replies:</p>

<p>“Thou ... indeed, being a man, probably
hast on the various island-headlands that thou
seest and on every beach-headland that thou
lookest on, a wife like the young herbs. But I,
alas! being a woman have no man except thee;
I have no spouse except thee!”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>What became of the children in the cases of
conjugal separation does not appear, a statement
that is made by no less a Japanese authority than
Chamberlain.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> In only one instance is there any
reference made to the fate of a child that had been
deserted, but this is an unusual case, where the
father had violated the rules of the parturition
house, with the result that the mother disappears,
leaving the father to take care of the child. He
pledged himself to look after it until the day of
his death but the sister of the child’s mother was
first invoked to act as nurse.</p>

<p>The result of this system of family life was that
where the children of different mothers but of
the same father discovered one another’s presence
there were feuds and much fighting, especially as
it was the children of the latest affection who were
generally the recipients of his favour to the chagrin
and anger of the less favoured children and families.
Marriages between half-brothers and half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>sisters
were another result of the system, the only
restriction on marriages of any kind being that
children of the same mother should not marry.
Sons of the same father were thus incited to be
enemies rather than brothers, in the accepted
sense, and the annals of the civil wars are replete
with tales of treachery and ambition and show
almost an entire absence of natural affection.
The fact that the children had no claim on the
love and the protection of the father and that
their mother was condemned under the ancient
system to the function of a mere animal, is cited
by Brinkley as the reason for this cruelty and
treachery.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>This was the position of the child in the society
that is depicted in the <i>Kojiki</i> and the <i>Nihongi</i>,
although the latter, written about forty years
after the <i>Kojiki</i> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 720), and under the influence
of the Chinese, is more apt to depict the
conditions that sprang up with the spreading
Chinese culture.</p>

<p>The fourth century brought to Japan a knowledge
of Chinese classics, and Chinese morals, and
in 552 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>, there came a still greater change when
the Buddhistic religion was introduced through a
copy of the scripture and an image of Buddha
being sent to the Yamato Court by the government
of one of the Korean kingdoms. Unsuccessful
preachments there had been by unofficial
missionaries before this, but the arrival of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Korean ambassador served to bring to the attention
of the government the new religion in a manner
calculated to arouse interest in its doctrines.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the defects of Shintoism,
human sacrifice never seems really to have been
part of its practice,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> and to this fact, with the increasing
regard for life that came with civilization,
is undoubtedly due the little emphasis given
to infanticide among the Japanese. Another influence,
undoubtedly, and this is said to be the
“best point of Shinto,”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> is that the people were
taught that they themselves were sons and daughters
of the gods, a belief apt to save the killing
of surplus members of society in a time of economic
stress.</p>

<p>According to the <i>Nihongi</i>, human sacrifice was
put an end to in Japan in the year <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 3:</p>

<p>“Tenth month, fifth day: Yamato-hiko, the Mikado’s
younger brother by the mother’s side, died.</p>

<p>“Eleventh month, second day: Yamato-hiko
was buried at Tsukizaka in Musa. Thereupon
his personal attendants were assembled, and were
all buried alive upright in the precinct of the tomb.
For several days they died not, but wept and wailed
day and night. At last they died and rotted.
Dogs and crows gathered and ate them.</p>

<p>“The Emperor, hearing the sound of their weeping
and wailing, was grieved at heart, and commanded
his high officers, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>“‘It is a very painful thing to force these whom
one has loved in life to follow him in death. Though
it be an ancient custom, why follow it if it is bad?
From this time forward, take counsel so as to put
a stop to the following of the dead.’</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 3, seventh month, sixth day: The Empress
Hibasuhime no Mikoto died. Sometime
before the burial the Emperor commanded his
ministers, saying:</p>

<p>“‘We have already recognized that the practice
of following the dead is not good. What should
now be done in performing this burial?’</p>

<p>“Thereupon Nomi no Sukune came forward and
said:</p>

<p>“‘It is not good to bury living men upright at the
tumulus of a prince. How can such a practice be
handed down to posterity? I beg leave to propose
an expedient which I will submit to your Majesty.’</p>

<p>“So he sent messengers to summon up from the
land of Idzumo a hundred men of the clay-workers
Be. He himself directed the men of the clay-workers
Be to take clay and form therewith shapes
of men, horses, and various objects, which he
presented to the Emperor, saying:</p>

<p>“‘Henceforward, let it be the law for future
ages to substitute things of clay for living men,
and to set them up at tumuli.’</p>

<p>“Then the Emperor was greatly rejoiced, and
commended Nomi no Sukune, saying:</p>

<p>“‘Thy expedient hath greatly pleased our
heart.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>“So the things of clay were first set up at the
tomb of Hibasuhime no Mikoto. And a name
was given to those clay objects. They were
called <i>hani-wa</i> or ‘clay rings.’</p>

<p>“Then a decree was issued, saying:</p>

<p>“‘Henceforth these clay figures must be set up
at tumuli; let no men be harmed.’</p>

<p>“The Emperor bountifully rewarded Nomi
no Sukune for this service, and also appointed
him to the official charge of the clay-workers Be.
His original title was therefore changed, and he
was called Hashi no Omi. This was how it came
to pass that the Hashi no Muraji superintended
the burials of Emperors.”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>The date ascribed to this incident cannot be
depended on. “Chinese accounts speak of the
custom of human sacrifices at the burial of a
sovereign as in full force in Japan so late as <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>
247,” says Aston. Probably all the events of
this part of Japanese history are very much antedated.
But of the substantial accuracy of the
narrative there can be no doubt. Some of these
clay figures (known as <i>tsuchi-ningio</i>) are still
in existence, and may be seen in the British
Museum, where they constitute the chief treasure
of the Gowland collection. The Uyeno Museum
in Tokio also possessed specimens, both of men
and horses. None, however, remain <i>in situ</i> at the
tombs. The <i>hani-wa</i> (clay-rings), cylinders which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>may now be seen embedded in the earth round all
the principal <i>misasagi</i>, are so numerous that they
can hardly have all been surmounted by figures.
But they are of the same workmanship and of the
same date, and no doubt some of them are the
pedestals of images, the above-ground part of
which has been destroyed by the weather or by
accident.</p>

<p>“A similar substitution of straw or wooden
images for living men took place in China in ancient
times, though by a curious inversion of ideas,
the former practice is described as leading to the
latter.”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>While neither the lion or the tiger ever troubled
Japan and her most carnivorous and destructive
animals have been wolves, tradition has ascribed
the sacrifice of human beings in Japan to the desire
to placate the god of wild animals. The victim
was always a girl, and from the earliest ages the
manner of selecting her was to affix to the roof of
a house a bow and arrow. When the householder
arose in the morning and discovered what was
accepted as a divine intimation, the eldest daughter
of the family was buried alive, it being supposed
that her flesh served as a meal for the deity.
Later the priests of Buddha found a more profitable
method of disposing of these girls by selling
them as slaves; thereby following out the fundamental
tenet of the Buddhistic religion, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the sanctity of human life, and at the same time
increasing their wealth. Some writers refer to this
practice as being a sacrifice to an animal in the
service of Shakamuni, which would have made it
a Buddhistic rite, but the idea is scoffed at by
Brinkley.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> Even up to recent times it is said
the habit of sacrificing human beings in order to
make the foundation of any great work more stable
was common. The corpses of two human beings
were said to be under the scarps “of the futile
forts hurriedly erected for defence of Yedo [Tokio]
in the interval between Commodore Perry’s first
and second coming.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>In the Tokugawa period, extending from about
1615 to 1860, two and a half centuries, Japan was
a hermit nation distinguished for its peaceful
character. Yet its population for one hundred
years remained almost stationary. By some
authorities, this has been explained not only on
the ground of many famines and devastating
diseases but the common practice of abortion and
the fact that the Samurai considered it disgraceful
to marry until they were thirty, and equally
disgraceful to raise a family of more than three
children.</p>

<p>“Among the lower classes it was not common to
rear all the children born, especially if girls came
too frequently.” Also, “While there was hardly
in the whole country a hospital in our sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the term, there were in the large cities physicians
famous for their skill in preventing the birth of
living children. They kept private establishments
to accommodate calculating patrons. All authorities
agreed that sexual morality in the large cities
was at a very low ebb among all classes, while
luxury and effeminacy prevailed among people
high in birth and wealth.”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>As a picture of what the people were driven to
and a terrible example of what attitude famine
may lead parents to take toward their children,
there is no more important document than the
statement of Shirakawa Rakuo, distinguished as
the Minister of Finance of the Eleventh Shogun,
Iyenari. The trace of cannibalism in semi-civilized
peoples is easier to understand after the
fearful famine in the third year of Temmei (1783).</p>

<p>“A trustworthy man,” says Rakuo,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> “who had
travelled in this district [northern part of country],
told me that in a village which had previously
contained 800 houses there were only thirty left,
the inhabitants of the rest all having died. Having
entered a village in which the houses seemed
to be larger and more numerous than usual, he
proposed to rest there for the night. He soon
discovered, however, that not a single house was
inhabited, but in all the houses he saw bones and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
skulls scattered about the floor. As he went on
he saw innumerable bones and skulls by the roadside.
He met a man leading a pack-horse on the
road, who said that he could survive without eating
the flesh of human beings as he was supported by
a rich uncle. In some places even those who
abandoned themselves to eating human flesh
could not find food enough to live. Great numbers
starved to death. The price paid for a dog
was 500 sen, sometimes even as high as 800 sen,
a rat 50 sen. A rare work of art found no purchasers
and could not be exchanged for a <i>go</i> of
rice. If a person died he was of course eaten by
the survivors. Those who died of starvation,
however, could not be eaten, because their flesh
decayed so soon. Some people, therefore, killed
those who were certain to starve and put the flesh
into brine so as to keep it for a long time. Among
other people there was a farmer who went to his
neighbour and said, ‘My wife and one of my sons
have already died from want of food. My remaining
son is certain to die within a few days,
so I wish to kill him while his flesh is still eatable,
but being his father, I do not dare to raise the
sword against him, so I beg you to kill the boy for
me.’ The neighbour agreed to do this, but stipulated
that he should get a part of the flesh as a
reward for his service. This was agreed to and the
neighbour at once killed the boy. As soon as the
deed was done, the farmer, who stood by, struck
his neighbour with a sword and killed him, saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
that he ‘was very glad to avenge his son and at
the same time have double the quantity of food.’”</p>

<p>Up to the close of the seventeenth century,
feudal legislation was very harsh, one of the worst
laws of ancient times in force until that time being
that by which children were punished for the
crime of their parents.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> If a man or a woman
had been sentenced to be crucified or burnt and
had male children above fifteen years of age,
those children were similarly executed, and if they
were under that age they were given over to a
relative to be reared until they reached the age
of fifteen, when they were banished. When the
criminal parent was condemned to the ordinary
hanging or beheading it was still within the discretion
of the judge to condemn the male children
to be executed or exiled. The female children,
while exempt from the capital punishment, were
liable to be sold as slaves.</p>

<p>In 1721, during the reign of the enlightened
Yoshimune, who was Shogun from 1716 to 1746,
there were many reforms, and it was then enacted
that for all crimes, even those punishable with
crucifixion and exposure of the head, only the
criminal himself must be punished. In the case
of the most heinous of all crimes, according to
Japanese standards, parricide or the murder of a
teacher, a special tribunal was declared to be the
only place where it could be decided whether the
children and grandchildren should be implicated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Interesting too is the fact that this leniency extended
to the farmers and merchants only, the
Samurai not being included, it being assumed that
the crime of a person of nobility and education
was a more serious matter than a crime by a person
less fortunate—a theory of justice that has never
taken root in the minds of the Occidentals except
among romancers.</p>

<p>From the time, early in the seventeenth century,
when the governing power of Japan fell into the
hands of the Buddhist Tokugawa family, through
Iyeyasu, the head of the house, there was an endeavour
to check the sale of children. No less
than eight enactments were issued between 1624
and 1734 declaring the sale of human beings
punishable by death.</p>

<p>Progress naturally was slow when the conditions
were so flagrant that there were open offices where
the sales and purchase of children were effected.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>
In 1649 an absurd compromise was attempted
when a law was passed declaring it was lawful to
sell a child, providing that the consent of the child
was obtained. There was an attempt to regulate,
without abolishing, slavery in the law of 1655,
which declared that in a dispute between an employer
and the employed, the employer, if found
to be in the wrong, might be imprisoned or meted
out any punishment that the employed might
suggest. It is safe to add that the administrative
criminal machinery was not in the hands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
proletariat, nor was there any suffrage that
threatened to put the employed in the position
of judge.</p>

<p>It was during this period that the law was passed
allowing the parent to have his son or daughter
imprisoned, a just cause being assumed. A father
had the right to punish his son, but the son had
the right to appeal to a magistrate for a review of
the sentence; but “costs” of the appeal were
dangerous inasmuch as if the son lost he had to
suffer whatever penalty his father might dole out
to him. The Occidental mind will not appreciate
so readily the attempts of the Tokugawas, beginning
1627, to regulate the social evil, one of their
early laws depriving employers of all authority
“to retain the services of a female for immoral
purposes outside the appointed quarter.”</p>

<p>Modern writers on Japan lay stress on the affection
of the Japanese for their children, and yet
“during the famine of 1905 many girls who had
been sold by the suffering parents were redeemed
by the Christians.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> This sacrifice of the children
to the welfare of the parents is traceable to the
influence of Confucius. To the same source may
be ascribed the fact that, though in ancient times
the female sex was prominent in Japan, after the
introduction of Confucianism the Samurai considered
it beneath him to even converse with his
wife and children.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> “Neither God nor the ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
inspired any enthusiasm in the Samurai’s heart,”
says Professor Chamberlain. For is it not written
by the great moralist Karbara Ekken in the <i>Owna
Dargaku</i>, “It was the custom of the ancients, on
the birth of a female child, to let it lie on the floor
for the space of three days. Even in this may
be seen the likening of the man to heaven and of
the woman to earth.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>Only a few years ago a child, both of whose
parents had died of cholera, was on the point of
being buried alive by neighbours when it was
rescued.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> “Certain parts of Japan have been notorious
from of old for this practice,” says Gulick.
“In Toas the evil was so rampant that a society
for its prevention has been in existence many
years. It helps support children of poor parents
who might be tempted to dispose of them criminally.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, this word from Professor
Goodrich, who as a member of the faculty of the
Imperial College pictures a nation far from indifferent
to the welfare of the child:</p>

<p>“Ever since the beginning of that indefinite
period which we call ‘modern times’ the birth of a
child has always been an occasion for rejoicing.
To be sure, in Japan that joy was very much
greater when it was a boy baby; yet the Japanese
have never displayed such intense dislike to girl
babies as have the Chinese. One great reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
for this was that the population of Japan was not
so dense as it is in China. It was easier to provide
for children, and therefore there was no incentive
to put girl babies out of the way. I am sorry to
say that very lately, since the Russo-Japanese
War (1904–5), when the Japanese people are
almost crushed by the weight of taxes to provide
money with which to pay war expenses and to keep
up army and navy, the number of cases of female
infanticide is increasing alarmingly.”<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>UR great grandfathers who accepted the
chronology of the good Bishop Usher,
by which the creation of the world was
placed neatly and exactly at 4004 years before
Christ, would never have dreamed of such periods
of time as those the ethnologist, in his search for
the natural history of man, compasses today in the
annals of a single family, like the so-called, and
at present discredited, Aryan. Nor yet would it
have seemed possible to our grandfathers, that
modern archæology would have made it possible
for our savants and scientists to be today correcting
the mistakes of Herodotus, and showing by
their decipherings of new-found inscriptions and
monuments, that before the earliest Greeks, the
Egyptians, and even the Semitic peoples who
inhabited Babylon and Assyria, there was another
people,—a people whose origin it is not possible to
place even now,—the Sumerians and Akkadians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
who in the fourth millennial period <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> were already
a cultured and civilized people.</p>

<p>Recent excavations have changed the entire
historical attack. Instead of beginning with the
Homeric Age as an age of legend, “civilization
may now be traced beyond the Mycenæan epoch,
through the different stages of Ægean culture
back into the Neolithic Age.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> In Egypt we
can now go back before the pyramid builders to
the earliest dynastic kings, even to Neolithic
Egyptians of whom there are no written records.
Back of the known civilization of Assyria and
Babylon, there has been discovered an even older
civilization.</p>

<p>“On the northern and eastern confines of the
Babylonian culture-system, new nations pass
within our ken; Vannic men of Armenia, ruled by
powerful kings; Kassites of the Zagros, whose
language seems to contain elements which if really
Aryan are probably the oldest known monuments
of Indo-European speech (c. 1600 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>); strange
tongued Elamites, also, akin neither to Iranian
nor Semite. Nor does it seem to us remarkable
that we should read the trilingual proclamations
of Darius Hystaspis to his peoples in their original
tongues, although an eighteenth century philosopher
would have regarded the prospect of our
ever being able to do so as the wildest of chimeras!”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>Recent excavations have established the fact
that the earliest known civilization was in what
afterwards came to be known as Mesopotamia,
between the Euphrates and the Tigris, and that
groups of people living in cities and calling themselves,
in the lower section of the country, the
Sumerians, and in the upper section, the Akkadians,
dwelt in civilized state until they were conquered
by the Semitic peoples. The Semites in
their conquest of the Greeks, as we now know,
took from the conquered the culture of the race
that was physically weaker, as indeed the Gauls
did from the Romans.</p>

<p>In government, law, literature, and art the Sumerians
were the superior people, and though the
Semites improved on their models, the impulse,
says King, came from the Sumerians.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> It is now
known that Hammurabi’s Code of Laws, which
influenced in so marked a degree the Mosaic
legislation, was of Sumerian origin, and the later
religions and mythological literature from which
the Hebrews borrowed so freely, was also of
Sumerian origin.</p>

<p>Even with the excavations that are now going
on and the discoveries that are being made almost
daily, our evidence is still too scanty and imperfect,
the gaps in it are too numerous,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> as Professor
Sayce says, apropos of the Babylonian religion, to
make it possible for us to discuss with any definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>ness
the attitude of these first civilized peoples toward
children. Years will pass before the tablets
already in the museums will have been deciphered,
to say nothing of those that are being dug out now.
A library of 30,000 tablets was discovered by M. de
Srazec at Telloh in Northern Babylonia, at Nippur
in the great temple of Bel, and five times as many
were discovered later by the American excavators.
Once the British Museum was the sole repository of
these treasures, containing everything from business
contracts to prayers to the gods, but now
they are in the Louvre, the Berlin Museum, the
Museum of Constantinople, the University of
Pennsylvania, and even in private collections.</p>

<p>From these Semitic conquerors of the Sumerians,
however, there came the first civilization and the
first humanization, for in this rich valley with its
abundance of water and its rich soil, the Nomads
became an agricultural people; there was plenty for
all, and the germ of human tolerance that the world
was to show later toward the child, was there in
that long ago pre-Semitic civilization of Babylonia.</p>

<p>Traces there are, however, of an earlier attitude,
when the first-born was sacrificed. Speaking of a
Babylonian text, that he believed established the
fact that there were sacrifices of the first-born
among the Sumerians, Professor Sayce said:</p>

<p>“My interpretation of the text has been disputed,
but it still appears to me to be the sole
legitimate one. The text is bilingual, in both
Sumerian and Semitic, and therefore probably goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
back to Sumerian times. Literally rendered, it
is as follows: ‘Let the <i>abgal</i> proclaim: the offspring
who raises his head among men, the offspring
for his life he must give; the head of his
head among men, the offspring for the head of the
man he must give, the neck of the offspring for
the neck of the man he must give, the breast of the
offspring for the breast of the man he must give.’”
It is difficult to attach any other meaning to this
than that which makes it refer to the sacrifice of
children.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>Further corroboration of this belief of Professor
Sayce was furnished by the recently dug up Stele
of the Vultures, now in the Louvre. Here there
is a representation of a wicker cage, filled with
captives who are waiting to be put to death by
the god Ningirsu, who holds in his hand the
heraldic emblem of the city of Lagash. The Stele
of the Vultures records the triumph of the King

of human sacrifice indicate, however, that
the practice had disappeared at an early date, but,
as we shall see, it did not entirely disappear, or
rather reappeared among the Semites of Palestine

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>More positive knowledge, however, we have of
the Sumerian laws, laws it should be remembered
that tell of a civilization 1000 years before the
Chinese.</p>

<p>That there was a sense of justice in Sumer
and Akkad long before the period of Hammurabi,
is evident from the inscriptions found at Tello
by Gerzec. Inscriptions of the year 3500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>,
according to Cuq, and about the year 2800, according
to Kang, show that Hammurabi was indebted
to the reform king, Urukagina, for many of his
laws. Urukagina declared that the people had
rights, and even went so far as to say that if the
king bought the property of a subject, he must pay
for it. We have many tablets telling of the wonderful
things that he did, but the one reform which
indicates that he had a regard for the family, and
consequently, there was probably more care for
children, is that provision of his laws which
deals with divorce.</p>

<p>In telling of his reforms in these inscriptions,
Urukagina records the fact that under the old
régime, if a man put away his wife, he paid the
<i>patesi</i> five shekels of silver and gave one to the
grand vizir.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly in the beginning, the object of
these fees was to prevent the nobles, and through
them by force of example, the plain people, from
putting away their wives too easily. In other
words there was a desire to hold together the old
Sumerian family. In the course of time, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
this became merely a bribe, for as the economic
conditions improved, the money became not so
much a deterrent as a bribe. One of the things
that Urukagina did was to abolish the fees of
divorce, and to attempt to stamp out practices that
were growing up.</p>

<p>Tablets of the time of Urukagina and his predecessor,
Lugalanda, translated by M. de Genouillac,
give some indication of what the family condition
was, although we still have to guess as to
what was the real attitude toward children. Women
were important; they could hold property
and they were protected in their property rights
by law. This in itself might indicate that there
were no such primeval practices as exposing or
drowning female children. Among these tablets
of Tello, is a series telling what provision was made
for the women who were attached to the Temple of
Bau, the goddess to whom the great ruler prays, as:</p>

<p>“... The one that grantest life unto the
land....</p>

<p>“Thou art the Queen, the mother that founded
Lagash.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> In these tablets the name of each
woman is followed with the number of infants belonging
to her family, and their sex. In all, two
hundred and twenty-nine infants are enumerated,
of which ninety-seven are boys and one hundred
and thirty-two, girls. Five hundred and fifty-two
women are named, but before coming to a conclusion
as to the percentage this shows of children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
to mothers, it is well, as de Genouillac points out,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>
to remember that among these five hundred and
fifty-two women there were many young girls.
Some idea of the size of the Sumerian family
may be obtained from the fact that the number of
infants charged to a single mother is seldom more
than four. Once the number seven occurs, but
this is in connection with the wife of the king,
and two of these children would seem to have
been adopted.</p>

<p>“The education of a large number of infants,”
concluded de Genouillac, “was encouraged by
the pension for mothers.” Here indeed was
progress!—at a time when there was nothing
but barbarism everywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note in these same tablets
the fact that the wife of the king or the <i>patesi</i>
was of great importance, for all documents signed
by Lugalanda bear the name of his wife, Barnamtarra,
and those under Urukagina have the signature
of his wife, Sagsag. It is more than likely
too, that the service mentioned above as being
for the Temple of Bau, was for the goddess’s
representative, the Queen Sagsag. Another
tablet, in which are set forth the expenses of the
servants who were apparently more attached to
the queen, speaks of thirty infants to fifty-seven
women,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> and in this and other tablets the frequent
reference to the orphans who were being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
taken care of, shows that there was provision for
the infant whose immediate protectors had passed
away.</p>

<p>In the Imperial Museum at Constantinople two
tablets show that parents were free to sell their
children and that these sales were frequent matters
of legal adjudication four centuries before Hammurabi.
Tablet No. 830, excavated at Tello, is
imperfect, but there is enough of it to show us
that in the month of the fête of the goddess Bau,
the daughter of Ab-ba-gi-na was sold by her father,
and the sale was confirmed and properly sworn to
and then registered. In Tablet No. 925, we have the
sale of a daughter to a cook, by a widow who was
probably in hard straits. The daughter tries to
break the contract and the mother stands by her,
but the cook brings two witnesses who prove that
the sale took place and was a proper one; as a result
of this attempted fraud, the master then inflicts
punishment on the slave.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>As a further evidence of the humanity of the
Sumerians, we have the fact that, like the Egyptians,
they had a god who presided over the <i>accouchements</i>,
a god who corresponded in some ways
to the Hera of the Greeks and the Juno of the Latins,
but who had other and more kindly functions,
and was there to ameliorate pain and apparently to
protect the young. Among the Greeks and Romans
the young were never thought of except as the
property of adults, whose interest always came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
first. In fact, among the Babylonians and Egyptians,
there was this essential difference, that the
goddess was really a midwife. Among the Sumerians,
she was known as Belitile, and was afterwards
identified with Mama, the goddess of
the young; and in two texts translated by P.
Dhorme,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> the two are referred to as one. Later
on the two goddesses were absorbed by the all-powerful
Istar.</p>

<p>It was in December, 1901, that M. J. de Morgan,
Director-General of the expedition sent out by the
French Government, while excavating the acropolis
of Susa, found three large fragments of a block
of black diorite among the debris.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> When fitted
together these three fragments formed a stele eight
feet high, on the upper end of the front side of
which was a bas-relief showing the sun-god,
Shamash, presenting the Code of Laws to the king,
Hammurabi.</p>

<p>Under this bas-relief was the longest cuneiform
Semitic inscription yet recovered, having sixteen
columns of text of which four and a half formed the
prologue. On the reverse of the stele there were
twenty-eight columns, the entire inscription being
estimated by Johns to contain “forty-nine columns
four thousand lines, and eight thousand words.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>Hammurabi, identified by Assyriologists as the
Amraphael of Genesis xiv., 1, was the sixth King
of the dynasty of Babylon, reigning over fifty-five
years, about 2250 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, and the first king to
consolidate the Semitic empire, making Babylon
the capital.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>There are two periods in the history of humanity:
one when the morals make the laws, and one
when the laws change the morals. The Code of
Hammurabi, the oldest known code in the world,
belongs to the second period.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p>While it appears from the prologue and epilogue
of the Code that Hammurabi was deeply devoted
to religion and was, in addition to being king, a
pious, God-fearing man, one who destroyed his
enemies North and South, the Code is strictly
devoted to civil and secular affairs. Nevertheless,
scarcely anything is known of the laws of the time
dealing with crimes, nothing having been discovered
to show how murder or theft was treated.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>Hammurabi’s Code is undoubtedly a compilation
and, while he enacted fresh laws, he built
for the most part on the foundations of other men.</p>

<p>In the Sumerian days that preceded these Semitic
kings, of whom Hammurabi, Sargon I., and Lugalzaggisi
were the greatest, there were codes of laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
on which Hammurabi doubtless built. The attitude
taken toward children in this period is indicated
in extracts from the series called <i>ana ittisu</i>,
the seven tablets of the series giving the following
seven laws:</p>

<p>“I. If a son has said to his father, ‘You are not
my father,’ he may brand him, lay fetters upon
him, and sell him.</p>

<p>“II. If a son has said to his mother, ‘You are
not my mother,’ one shall brand his forehead,
drive him out of the city, and make him go out of
the house.</p>

<p>“III. If a father has said to his son, ‘You are
not my son,’ he shall leave house and yard.</p>

<p>“IV. If a mother has said to her son, ‘You are
not my son,’ he shall leave house and property.</p>

<p>“V. If a wife hates her husband and has said,
‘You are not my husband,’ one shall throw her into
the river.</p>

<p>“VI. If a husband has said to his wife, ‘You
are not my wife,’ he shall pay half a mina of
silver.</p>

<p>“VII. If a man has hired a slave and he dies, is
lost, has fled, has been incapacitated, or has fallen
sick, he shall measure out 10 <i>ka</i> of corn <i>per diem</i> as
his wages.”<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>From this it will be observed that if the son
repudiates his parent, real or adoptive, he meets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
with a swift and heavy punishment. On the other
hand, a father and mother have the power to drive
the child out without any ceremony whatever.
That such laws were the result of the disposition
of foundling children is without question. We will
see later that the Roman Empire in its endeavour
to save the lives of children, was continually attempting
legislative reforms for the purpose of
giving men and women incentive to protect the
helpless infant that had been deserted by its own
parents.</p>

<p>Adoption was an ancient institution, and the
rights of the man who adopted the infant were
protected in order that he might be paid for the
trouble and expense of his charge.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>The adoption of children in the Code of Hammurabi
is the subject of much minute regulation.
In the Code the endeavour to protect the father
who picks up a child, is shown in paragraphs 185,
186, 187 and 188:</p>

<p>“185. If a man take in his name a young child
as a son and rear him, one may not bring claim for
that adopted son.</p>

<p>“186. If a man take a young child as a son, and,
when he takes him, he is rebellious toward his
father and mother (who have adopted him), that
adopted son shall return to the house of his
father.</p>

<p>“187. One may not bring claim for the son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
a <span class="smcap">NER. SE. GA</span>, who is a palace guard, or the son
of a devotee.</p>

<p>“188. If an artisan take a son for adoption and
teach him his handicraft, one may not bring claim
for him.”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>Coming down to a later period, we may see the
influence of other peoples on the Babylonians in
the <i>Assyrian Doomsday Book</i> or <i>Liber Censualis</i>,
copied from the cuneiform tablets of the seventh
century, <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span><a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> Sixty-eight families are enumerated
in these tablets, and to these sixty-eight husbands
there are allotted ninety-four wives. Seventy-four
sons are mentioned and only twenty-six
daughters, a proportion that is extremely suspicious.
That there was no such slaughter of the
females as we find in other countries, is shown by
the fact that in some of the families enumerated
there were as many as three daughters to one son,
but the majority of the families were without
female children and had one or two sons, an evenness
of distribution which would lead one to surmise
that the people of the district of Harran, where this
census was taken, were regulating the birthrate
themselves.</p>

<p>Of this period too, is the story of Sargon the
younger—a legend that is interesting not alone
because of its similarity to that of Moses, but
because it shows that this section of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
had also fallen into the ways of the rest of the
world. Here, at the time of the legend, it was a
common thing for a child to run the risks of exposure
and death.</p>

<p>As an indication of the conditions a thousand
years later, we may take the certificate of adoption
cited by Dr. Rogers, of the time of King Kurigalzu
who reigned in Babylon from about 1390
<span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> to 1375.</p>

<p>“Ina-Uruk-rishat, daughter of (mu) shallim,
had no daughter and therefore she adopted Etirtu,
daughter of Ninib-mushallim, as her daughter.
Seven shekels of gold she gave. She may give her
to a husband, she may appoint her a temple slave,
<i>but</i> she may not make her a servant. If she does
make her a servant, Etirtu shall go to her father’s
house. As long as Ina-Uruk-rishat lives, Etirtu
shall pay her reverence. When Ina-Uruk-rishat
dies, Etirtu, as her daughter, shall offer the water
libation. If Ina-Uruk-rishat should say, ‘Thou art
not my daughter,’ she shall lose the gold which she
has paid. If Etirtu should say, ‘Thou art not
my mother,’ she shall become a servant. There
shall no claim be made. Before Ellil, Ninib, Nusku,
and King Kurigalzu they have made oath
together.</p>

<p>“Before Damkum, her uncle on the mother’s
side. Before Rabasha-Ninib. Before Ellil-ibni,
son of Ellil-ishu. Before Etel-pi-Azagshug, son
of Amel-Marduk; before Rish-Marduk, son of
Ba’il-Nusku; before Arad-Belit, the scribe, son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Ninib-mushallim. The fifth day of Shebat, the
twenty-first year of Kurigalzu, king of the world.”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p>From another point of view we may also understand
the Babylonian morality. As a characteristic
it is interesting to note “that the general
modesty of the Babylonian art, in the matter of
clothes, is very marked,” says Ward, “we never
see any display of Phallism.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> That the influence
and importance of the women had much to do with
the character of these people is undoubtedly true.</p>

<p>They were a truly remarkable people of whom
we are yet to learn a great deal. Future excavations
may reveal much, but up to now “the abundant
literature of Babylon,” says Dussaud, “does
not offer a single example of human sacrifice and
yet one has the right to suppose that it was
common among them.”<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

Egyptian Hamites, as a truly autochthonous race,
were evolved.</p>

<p>In a climate particularly favourable, great progress
was made by these aboriginal people, especially
in the New Stone Age, which was of
unusually long duration, as can be seen from the
beautiful flint knives plated with gold on which
are carved animal figures.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> That the actual beginnings
of Egyptian culture are twice as long as

<small>(REPRODUCED FROM “THE GODS OF THE EGYPTIANS, OR STUDIES IN EGYPTIAN MYTHOLOGY”)</small></div>
</div>

<p>It is therefore not surprising that we find among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>the Egyptians, just as we find among the Sumerians
and the Akkadians, who were contemporaneous in
civilization about four and five thousand years
before Christ, that the attitude toward children is
settled, and apparently in the child’s favour;
for aside from occasional sacrificial offerings in
which the child is on a par at least with the slave
or the servant about to be sacrificed, there is no
evidence of the endeavour to do away with the
children on the scale that we find in ancient Greece
and Rome and later in India and China.</p>

<p>Had there been, however, less positive division
of castes in Egypt, the infants of the higher class
would not have been as well treated. The lives
of the military and priestly castes were almost
sacred<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>; it was on them that the king relied for
support, and the rest of the population, whether
nominally free or slave, were foreordained to a life
of incessant toil. Maspero quotes from the Sellier
Papyrus, a satiric poem, which goes to show the
conditions in the earliest time among these workmen
whose lives of hardship were only varied by
the irregular visits of the tax-gatherers. These
visits, though dreaded, were never prepared for and
were always the occasions of several days of protestations,
threats, beating, cries of pain from the
tax-payers, lamentations from the women and children,
the gathering up of the tax, the departure of the
tax-collectors and then the calm with the resumption
of labour until the next visit of the collectors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>“I have never seen a blacksmith on an embassy,”
so runs the complaint of the proletariat 3000 years
before Christ,—“nor a smelter sent on a mission—but
what I have seen is the metal worker at his
toil,—at the mouth of the furnace of his forge,—his
fingers as rugged as the crocodile, and stinking
more than fish-spawn. The artisan of any
kind who handles the chisel, does not employ so
much movement as he who handles the hoe;
but for him his fields are the timber, his business is
the metal, and at night when the other is free,—he,
he works with his hands over and above what
he has already done, for at night, he works at
home by the lamp. The stone-cutter who seeks
his living by working in all kinds of durable stone,
when at last he has earned something, and his two
arms are worn out, he stops; but if at sunrise he
remain sitting, his legs are tied to his back. The
barber who shaves until the evening, when he falls
to and eats, it is without sitting down—while
running from street to street to seek custom;
if he is constant (at work) his two arms fill his belly,
as the bee eats in proportion to its toil. Shall I
tell thee of the mason—how he endures misery?
Exposed to all the winds—while he builds without
any garment but a belt—and while the bunch of
lotus-flowers (which is fixed) on the (completed)
houses—is still far out of his reach—his two arms
are worn out with work; his provisions are placed
higgledy piggledy amongst his refuse, he consumes
himself, for he has no other bread than his fingers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
and he becomes wearied all at once. He is much
and dreadfully exhausted—for there is (always) a
block (to be dragged) in this or that building,
a block of ten cubits by six,—there is (always)
a block (to be dragged) in this or that month (as
far as the) scaffolding poles (to which is fixed) the
bunch of lotus-flowers on the (completed) houses.
When the work is quite finished, if he has bread,
he returns home, and his children have been beaten
unmercifully (during his absence). The weaver
within doors is worse off there than a woman;
squatting, his knees against his chest,—he does
not breathe. If during the day he slackens weaving,
he is bound fast to the lotuses of the lake;
and it is by giving bread to the doorkeeper, that
the latter permits him to see the light. The dyer,
his fingers reeking—and their smell is that of fish-spawn;—his
two eyes are oppressed with fatigue,
his hand does not stop,—and, as he spends his time
in cutting out rags—he has a hatred of garments.
The shoemaker is very unfortunate; he moans
ceaselessly, his health is the health of the spawning
fish, and he gnaws the leather. The baker makes
dough, subjects the loaves to the fire; while
his head is inside the oven, his son holds him by
the legs; if he slips from the hands of his son, he
falls there into the flames.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<p>The matriarchal tendencies of the Egyptian
Government also account for the fact that children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
as a rule, were not only allowed to live but were
better treated than they were among other peoples.
Even the first Egyptians, although semi-savages
like those inhabiting Africa and America, were
different in their attitude toward women to such
an extent that the Greeks were led into believing
that in Egypt the woman was supreme. The
husband entered the house of the wife instead of
the wife entering his<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> and this led to the children
recognizing the parental relation through the
mother alone.</p>

<p>To this matriarchal tendency may also be attributed
the activity of Maskonit, the god who appeared
at the child’s cradle at the very moment of
its birth, and Raninit, who gave him his name and
saw that he was properly nursed. With two such
deities in the list of gods, obviously the creations
of women and hardly those of semi-savage men,
it was evident that the women were using their best
supernatural means to protect childhood. Significant,
too, may be the fact that these protecting
deities were goddesses, for, as may be seen from the
story of the ill-fated prince,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>—there was always a
chance that either the crocodile, the serpent, or
the dog, might get the infant. In the possibility
of death by either of the three, there was the memory
of days when mothers were either less careful
or had not much authority.</p>

<p>Such knowledge as we have of the kings of the
Fifth Dynasty indicates that they were builders,
but it was during this dynasty, in the reign of Tetka-Ra
(about 3366 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>), that what has been described
as the oldest book in the world, the <i>Precepts of Ptah-Hotep</i>,
was written. In this remarkable document
the first care of the author after a stirring picture
of old age, for it is evident that Ptah-Hotep wrote
in his old age, is to enjoin those who read, that by
following in the ways of the fathers, the children
will prosper. All through there are, as M. Chabas
pointed out, evidences that it furnished the basis
for many of the later injunctions of the Hebrews
in regard to filial obedience:</p>

<p>“Bring up your son in obedience.”</p>

<p>“The son who receives the word of his father
will live to be old because of it.”</p>

<p>“Beloved of God is obedience; disobedience is
hated by God.”</p>

<p>The later injunction of Ecclesiastes, ix., 9, is
found in the 18th rubric:</p>

<p>“If you are wise take good care of your house;
love your wife and cherish her.”<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>The husband and wife are frequently represented
together at this time, and their attitude toward
one another is most affectionate. In the group of
M’Ayptah we see the Priest of Ptah in what to our
modern understanding is a real family group, not
unlike those the photographer of the congested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
districts in large cities is frequently called on to
perpetuate. On the left of the Priest is his wife,
Ha’tshepest, while on his right is his grown-up
daughter. Two smaller figures represent a second
daughter and the grandson of M’Ayptah.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> The
prominence of women here in relations so affectionate
is unlike anything that we find in other ancient
nations, and argues the presence of a spirit different
from that of most nations at the same stage of
culture.</p>

<p>In the time of the Old Kingdom (from the Third
to the Sixth Dynasty), a man had but one wife, who
was the mother of his heirs, was in every respect
his equal, and shared authority with the father
over the children. The natural line of inheritance
was through the eldest daughter, and the closest
ties were through the mother.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Adventures of Sanehat</i>, a story written apparently
at the time of Amenemhat I., the founder
of the Twelfth Dynasty, Sanehat’s description
of his reception in the court of the king, when
the royal children were brought forth to join in the
general celebration, would also indicate that there
was no desire to show any preference to either
sex.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>That human sacrifice lasted up to the Eleventh
Dynasty<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> is the belief of Messrs. King and Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
who point to the excavations at Thebes, in the
precinct of the funerary temple of Nebhapet-Ra-Mentuhetep
and about the central pyramid
which commemorated his memory. There were
buried a number of ladies of his <i>harim</i>, who were
without doubt killed and buried at the same time,
in order that they might accompany their royal
master to his new abiding place. With each of
these ladies there was buried a little waxen human
figure placed in a little coffin, the image being
intended to take the place of the slave of the lady
of the <i>harim</i>. As the ladies were not royal, real
slaves were not killed for them, which shows that
the idea of sacrifice even then had contracted until
it was restricted to personages of the highest rank.</p>

<p>According to Porphyry, who quotes a work of
Manetheo on <i>Antiquity and Piety</i>,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> the law permitting
or ordering the sacrifice of men was
repealed by Amosis. Amosis, it is said, ordered
that waxen images be substituted. The excavators
have found not only the wax images but those
of later days, when wood and glazed <i>faience</i> as
well as stone were used, the growing humanity
of the age seeking in this way to progress from
the primitive indifference to the death of others.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p>

<p>Nowhere is there any evidence that among the
Egyptians of the Old, and Middle or New period
(that is from the Fourth Dynasty up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Twentieth, or from about 2800 to 110 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>),
children were ill-treated or suffered from any of the
usual methods of getting rid of surplus progeny.
It is true that the monuments are more given to
warlike exploits than to revelations of social manners,
but the conditions in early Egypt all seem to
point to the fact that, living in a land of plenty,
they had early passed beyond the stage when the
life of the child was the first sacrifice to the god
of necessity.</p>

<p>In this connection it must be said that the
only direct evidence we have from the ancients
is that of Diodorus Siculus, a contemporary of
Cæsar, who visited Egypt in the course of his
thirty years’ preparation for his historical work.
In what he says of the punishment of those who
killed their children, he is citing the ancient Egyptians
before they came under the influence of the
Greeks and Romans:</p>

<p>“Parents that killed their children, were not
to die, but were forced for three days and nights
together to hug them continually in their arms,
and had a guard all the while over them, to see
they did it; for they thought it not fit that they
should die, who gave life to their children; but
rather that men should be deterred from such
attempts by a punishment that seemed attended
with sorrow and repentance.”<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p>In another section of his work, Diodorus is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
evidently speaking of the Egyptians of his own
day:</p>

<p>“The Egyptian priests only marry one wife,
but all others may have as many wives as they
please; and all are bound to bring up as many
children as they can, for the further increase of
the inhabitants, which tends much to the well-being
either of a city or country. None of the
sons are ever reputed bastards, though they be
begotten of a bond maid, for they conceive that
the father only begets the child, and that the
mother contributes nothing but place and nourishment.
And they call trees that bear fruit, males,
and those that bear none, females; contrary to
what the Grecians name them. They bring up
their children with very little cost and are sparing,
upon that account, to admiration: for they provide
them broth, made of any mean and poor
stuff that may be easily had; and feed those that
are of strength able to eat it, with the pith of bulrushes,
roasted in the embers, and with roots and
herbs got in the fens; sometimes raw, and sometimes
boiled; and at other times fried and boiled.
Most of their children go barefooted and naked,
the climate is so warm and temperate. It costs not
the parent to bring up a child to man’s estate,
above twenty drachmas; which is the chief reason
why Egypt is so populous, and excels all other
places in magnificent structures. The priests
instruct the youth in two sorts of learning; that
which they call sacred, and other, which is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
common and ordinary. In arithmetic and geometry,
they keep them a long time: for in this
regard, as the river every year changes the face
of the soil, the neighbouring inhabitants are at
great difference among themselves concerning the
boundaries of their land, which cannot be easily
known but by the help of geometry.”<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p>Strabo also speaks of the Egyptians as exceptions,
when he refers to the parents’ power of life
and death over children: and others assert that
while they were cruel toward the new-born of the
Hebrews, they were kind toward their own.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></p>

<p>The early development of the belief in a hereafter,
as it showed itself in the unusual care of the
body of the deceased, also affected, without doubt,
the attitude of the Egyptians toward their own
progeny, if it did not affect it toward that of others;
in dealing with the primitive and early peoples we
must always realize that we can understand them
only by the way in which they dealt with their own.
Their kindness to their own, argued an advanced
civilization—to test their degree of civilization by
the attitude they took to the children of slaves or
the children of servants, is to ask more of them
than we can ask of our contemporaries.</p>

<p>In the desire to look after the future life, the
Egyptians were exceptional, as their embalming
showed. They lived in a salubrious country, they
boasted that they were “the healthiest of mor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>tals,”<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>
and so great was their horror that any one
should mutilate the human form, that the <i>paraschistes</i>
παρασχιστἡς who made the necessary incisions
in the dead when a body was to be embalmed,
became an object of execration as soon as his job
was over. According to Diodorus Siculus, he was
always assaulted by his own assistants, stones being
thrown at him with such violence that he had to
take to his heels in order to escape with his life.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></p>

<p>Perhaps it is a far cry, but it seems as though a
people who made such preparations as the Egyptians
did for the dead, would have been chary of
causing the death of those who had sprung from
their own loins. For the care of the dead was not
confined to the noble and the wealthy alone—the
lower classes were also affected by the desire for a
proper kind of funeral, to the extent that enterprising
people procured an old empty tomb, enlarged
it, and let places out in it. Hither then, came the
fisherman, the peasant, and the dancing girl—in
death they were the equal of the king, for they
were buried with ceremony, their bodies were
placed where the tomb equipment might be by
them—and thus with the king, the noble, and the
wealthy, they waited the time that was to be.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p>Among such a people it is hard to think that
the death of even a child was treated lightly.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>Of the Egyptians after the conquest of Alexander
we must write as of the Greeks; and in the
matter of children it is important to note that
a recently discovered papyrus, written in Greek
in the year 1 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, shows how completely the foreign
point of view had been absorbed in a land
in which four thousand years yielded up not a
single evidence of the assassination of children.</p>

<p>The papyrus is a letter from Illarion, whose
home is at Oxyrhynchus, and who evidently has
gone to Alexandria with other workmen. He has
apparently not sent his wife many messages of affection
despite the fact that she is about to have
a child. When the other workmen are going to
return home, he plans to stay in Alexandria, but
he promises to send home some of his wages. The
part of the letter that is most interesting to us is
his injunction that if the child that is expected
should turn out to be a female, it should be cast
out. In the salutation, Illarion refers to his wife
as his sister, marriages between brother and sister
having been common in Egypt, and the term being
one of endearment. The letter follows:</p>

<p>“Illarion to Alis his sister, many Greetings,
and to mother Berous and Apollonarion. Know
that I am still even now at Alexandria. I urge
and entreat you to be careful of the child, and if I
receive wages soon I will send it to you. When
you bear offspring, if it is a male let it be, if a female
expose it.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N an examination of the attitude of early man
toward the child, there could be no more
illuminating study than that of the habits of
our own ancestry, the so-called Aryan primitives.</p>

<p>Whether the cradle of the race was in India and
spread from there throughout Europe, or whether
the original habitat was Central Europe, the fact
remains that the earliest records of the civilization
of all of the races from the Indians and
Aryans in Asia to the Celts, Teutons, Hellenes,
Goths, and Italians indicate that they were a
pastoral rather than an agricultural people and
that while the family was the unit, the father was
undoubtedly the supreme power that later marked
the <i>pater familias</i> in Rome.</p>

<p>The mere absence of fish-hooks in the archæological
remains and the fact that the Aryans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
were for a long time a fish-hating race (the word
fish-eater used as a term of opprobrium by Herodotus,
there being no mention of eating fish in
the Vedas and only occasionally in Homer) go to
show how limited was the food of that race. It
is only as the various branches of the race developed
that they came to know the art of fishing
and the value of fish, a fact that is shown in the
lack of a common name for fish in the Aryan
tongues. The age of Homer was really the beginning
of the Iron Age of the Aryan people, the culture
of Italy and Hellas resulting from a “lengthened
process of historical evolution” stimulated and
developed by contact with the high culture of the
Semites, which again was derived from the proto-Babylonian
people.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p>Up to this time in the struggle for existence of
these semi-savages everything was sacrificed for
war, and infanticide and human sacrifice were
practised, there being reason to believe that even
cannibalism was practised in Britain, if not by the
Celts certainly by the Iberians.</p>

<p>Early Greek myths reveal a condition of society
little different from that which the missionaries in
recent years have found at Dahomey. Children
were killed when they were not wanted; wives
were bought and sold. The practice of breaking
a bottle over the bow of a vessel is a survival of a
savage practice of the vikings of binding a human
being to the prow when the war galley was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
launched in order that the keel might be sprinkled
with sacrificial blood.</p>

<p>Recent philological research corrected by archæological
discovery has established the fact that the
members of the Aryan race up to the time of the
Homeric legends were nomad herdsmen who had
domesticated the dog and wandered over the plains
of Europe in wagons drawn by oxen. They knew
how to fashion canoes out of the trunks of trees
but with the exception of native copper they were
ignorant of metals. It is extremely doubtful if
they practised any agriculture. They collected
and pounded in stone mortars the seed of some
wild cereal, either spelt or barley. They recognized
the association of marriage but they were
polygamous. They practised human sacrifice and
they retained after birth only those children that
they could conveniently rear, or those male children
who were regarded as necessary for the increase of
the fighting forces of the tribe.</p>

<p>Upon the Dasyas, the dark-skinned, flat-nosed
people who originally inhabited India, the Aryans
triumphantly descended, eventually driving the
Dasyas out of their lands. From the Rig Vedas
we learn the nature of the Aryan conqueror. He
was a warrior, but he was a prayerful warrior
who prayed for health, a defensive armour, and a
comfortable dwelling. There were frequent sacrifices
to the gods and at all of the sacrifices interesting
philosophical and sphagiological discussions
took place. In his prayers he prayed for racy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>and healthy children, but he always prayed for
boys and never for girls. His children were part
of his scheme of wealth; they were his body and
soul.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

</div>

<p>The two great epics, the <i>Mahabharata</i> and the
<i>Ramayana</i>, are the two sources of information
on this period. Written down when the art of
writing became known about the year 800 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>,
these books mirror the life of the people for centuries
further back. The attitude toward children
can only be gleaned from such statements as
that Bhishma, one of the heroes of the <i>Mahabharata</i>,
was the eighth son of his father, and the first
to be allowed to live. The deaths of the previous
seven are explained on the ground that his father
Shantanu, the King of Hastinapur, was married to
Ganga, the river goddess, who had consented to be
the wife of the King on condition that, no matter
what he might see her do, he would ask no questions.
When she, however, having drowned the
seven, attempted to drown the eighth son, he was
obliged to cry “enough,” thereby saving the son
but losing his wife, who departed declaring that the
previous seven sons had been seven of the deities,
condemned to a fresh life for some venial sin, and
had been released by her from their punishment by
an early death.</p>

<p>With such a story recited as semi-religious doctrine
it can easily be seen why there grew up early
the feeling that there was no crime in taking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
lives of those children who were regarded as unnecessary.</p>

<p>Bhishma takes a vow not to marry, in accordance
with which he refuses the offer of Amva who
revenges herself when she is born a second time,
as Chikandini, the daughter of a great king. The
epic opens up another view of the early Aryan
attitude when it is stated that Chikandini, although
a daughter, is allowed to live; but in order
to accomplish this her mother hides her sex for
twenty-one years.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>In the Sankhayana-Grihya-Sutra there is a
long description of the ceremony of the Pumsavana
(the ceremony to secure the birth of a
male child) which with its earnest prayer for a
male child, not only at the time of coition but
again with much ceremony in the third month,
shows that the female child was doomed to a most
unwelcome reception at the very best. As we
shall see later, these ceremonies were bound to
produce, in the course of time, not only the practice
of killing female infants without remorse
but even the disgusting ceremonies that marked
female infanticide in some places.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>The feeling of these people at all times about
women is best expressed in the words of the ordinance
of Manu: “Women are born to bear children.”<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a>
The female child that escaped death had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
therefore a sharply defined life before it. It is a
question, as Professor Gottheil suggests, as to
whether it is a degeneracy that brings about the
death of these infants in view of the life they would
be obliged to lead. Girls were betrothed at three
or four years of age and at seven had gone through
the ceremony of marriage to boys of whom they
knew nothing, and when those boys died they remained
virgin widows. At one time it was possible
for them to be taken to their boy husbands’
homes and in some instances they became mothers
before they were eleven. Not until March 19,
1891, was a law passed in India prohibiting cohabitation
before twelve.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<p>Vatsyayana, an ancient Hindu sage, author of
the Kama-sutra, in which are given rules for the
domestic life of the Hindus, mirrors the point of
view of his time, about the first century, <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>
According to Vatsyayana parents were to show to
their children all indulgence and freedom—until
they were five. From five to sixteen they were to
be instructed in the fourteen sciences and sixty-four
arts, after which time the lord of creation was
enjoined to become a householder.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>Of this early period there is plenty of evidence
of human sacrifice which, even when it did not
consist entirely of children, led to the slaughter of
children. “There is no evidence,” as Professor
Wilson says, “that the practice ever prevailed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
the extent to which it spread through most of the
ancient nations, or partook in general of the same
character. They were in the main sacrifices of an
expiatory nature performed in fear and intended
to deprecate the anger of the gods.”<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>Monier-Williams suggests that it is possible that
human sacrifice was at one time part of the
Brahmanical system and adduces the story of
Hariskandra and Sunahsepa as an evidence of
that practice.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> In this legend, Hariskandra, being
childless, prays to Varuna to grant him a son, vowing
to sacrifice him to the god. A son is born but
the father does not keep his word, and when the
son reaches the age of discretion he refuses to become
a victim. From a starving Brahman he
purchases a son for one hundred cows, but this
victim escapes by being adopted by the priest
Visvamitra who is a royal sage.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p>In the Purushamedha, or the section of the
Satapatha-Brahmana dealing with the human sacrifice,
a large number of men and women are bound
to eleven sacrificial posts, and after the necessary
rites have been performed on them, they are set
free and eleven animals are killed instead. That
in times previous to this adoption human beings
had been sacrificed, there is no doubt.</p>

<p>Despite all that can be said in favour of the
Buddhistic religion and the reforms that it wrought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
it is not possible to find that it made any change
in the attitude of the Hindus toward their children
or the practices of the day as did the religion
of Christ and later the religion of Mohammed, one
of which sanctified the child, while the other
expressly forbade infanticide. Laying down the
law that life was a period of suffering and humility,
the Buddhistic religion still declared that Nirwana
was not obtainable by those under seven, so that
the life of the child did not take on any increased
value under the new religion of Gautama.</p>

<p>It was natural that with no forceful check on
infanticide contained in the new religion, the
primitive idea so well planted should spread and
become stronger rather than diminish. It is
therefore not surprising that in the Manava-dharma-castra
ascribed by Burnell<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> to the period
between the year 1 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> to the year 500, the daughter
is placed very low in the scale of things human:</p>

<p>“184—Children, old people, the poor and sick,
are to be known [to be] lords of the sky; an elder
brother is equal to a father; a wife and son are
one’s own body.</p>

<p>“185—And one’s own servants are one’s own
shadow; a daughter is the chief miserable object.
Therefore offended by these, one should always
bear it without heat.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></p>

<p>That infanticide was so common in the time of
Alexander that it attracted the attention even of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
that Greek in his march of conquest through the
country, is evident in the records that he brought
back.</p>

<p>Q. Curtius Rufus relates,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> that on entering the
kingdom of Sophytes, Alexander was astonished
at the wisdom of the laws of this barbarian.
According to Curtius and Diodorus, Sophytes was
governor of a territory west of the Hyphasis while
according to Arrian it lay along the banks of the
Hydaspes.</p>

<p>“Here,” says Curtius, “they do not acknowledge
and rear children according to the will of the
parents, but as the officers entrusted with the
medical inspection of infants may direct, for if
they have remarked anything deformed or defective
in the limbs of a child they order it to be killed.
In contracting marriages they do not seek an
alliance with high birth, but make their choice
by the looks, for beauty in the children is a quality
highly appreciated.”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<p>“These,” said Diodorus Siculus, “were governed
by laws in the highest degree salutary, for while
in other respects their political system was one to
admire, beauty was held among them in the highest
estimation. For this reason a discrimination
between the children born to them is made at the
stage of infancy, when those that are perfect in
their limbs and features, and have constitutions
which promise a combination of strength and
beauty, are allowed to be reared, while those that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
have any bodily defect are condemned to be
destroyed as not worth rearing. They make their
marriages also in accordance with this principle,
for in selecting a bride they care nothing whether
she has a dowry and a handsome fortune besides,
but look only to her beauty and other advantages
of the outward person.”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></p>

<p>“A very singular usage,” says Strabo, “is related
of the high estimation in which the inhabitants
of Cathaie hold the quality of beauty, which
they extend to horses and dogs. According to
Onesicritus, they elect the handsomest person as
king. The child [selected], two months after birth,
undergoes a public inspection, and is examined.
They determine whether it has the amount of
beauty required by law, and whether it is worthy
to be permitted to live. The presiding magistrate
then pronounces whether it is to be allowed to
live, or whether it is to be put to death.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p>As far as I have been able to discover, the first
attempt made by the British Government and
perhaps the first organized effort in the Eastern
world to put an end to the murder of female children
was in 1789 when the British resident officer
of Benares, Jonathan Duncan, afterwards Governor
of Bombay, authenticated from the confessions of
a race called the Rajekoomars the existence of
the custom. Sir John Shore, afterwards a witness
in the trial of Warren Hastings, and later Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Teignmouth, in an address to the Royal Society
of Bengal in 1794 described how, after many
suggestions, it was decided that the only way that
the Rajekoomars could be moved was by getting
them to sign an “engagement” binding them to
desist “in future from the barbarous practice of
causing the death of their female children.”</p>

<p>Inasmuch as that engagement was the beginning
of the work in India and was afterwards used as a
model for other engagements and reveals a curious
attitude of mind on both sides, I reprint it in full:</p>

<p>“Whereas it hath become known to the Government
of the Honourable English East India
Company, that we, the tribe of <i>Rajekoomars</i>, do
not suffer our female children to live; and whereas
this is a great crime, as mentioned in the <i>Brehma
Bywant Pooran</i>, where it is said that killing even
a <i>Fetus</i> is as criminal as killing a <i>Brahman</i>, and
that for killing a female, or woman, the punishment
is to suffer in the <i>nerk</i>, or hell, called <i>Kat
Shootul</i>, for as many years as there are hairs on
that female’s body, and that afterwards that person
shall be born again, and successively become a
leper and be afflicted with the <i>Jukhima</i>; and
whereas the British Government in India, whose
subjects we are, have an utter detestation of such
murderous practices, and we do ourselves acknowledge,
that although customary among us they are
highly sinful, we do therefore hereby agree not to
commit any longer such detestable acts; and any
among us (which God forbid) who shall be here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>after
guilty thereof, or shall not bring up and
get our daughters married to the best of our
abilities among those of our caste, shall be expelled
from our tribe, and shall neither eat, nor keep
society, with us, besides suffering hereafter the
punishments denounced in the above <i>Pooran</i> and
<i>Shafter</i>. We have therefore entered into this
agreement.</p>

<p>
“Dated the 17th of December, 1789.”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a><br />
</p>

<p>On May 27, 1805, Colonel Alexander Walker,
the resident at Baroda, called the attention of the
government at Bombay to the conditions in Guzerat,
and the government authorized him to go
ahead and use such measures as he deemed wise
to suppress infanticide, sending him a copy of the
engagement of Duncan as a suggestion of lines that
might be profitably employed.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<p>It was while in the course of his investigations
and work in suppressing the practice that Colonel
Walker heard first from the Hindus the supposedly
divine origin of the practice of putting female
children to death. It was the supposedly divine
origin and the fact that they acted within the observance
of their religious duties that gave protection
against interference from civil authorities.
The Jharejas, a tribe among whom Walker made
his investigations, informed him that the origin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the practice of infanticide came about through the
fact that a powerful Raja of their caste, who had a
daughter of singular beauty and accomplishments,
desired his Rajgor or family Brahmin to affiance
her to a prince of desert and rank equal to her
own.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<p>The Rajgor, after much travelling, returned to
the Raja and informed him that he was not able to
find any one to meet the proper requirements.
The Raja was so dejected over this that, according
to the story, he finally consented to the Rajgor’s
putting his daughter to death as the only means out
of the difficulty; and from that time on, according
to the Jharejas, female infanticide was practised
throughout the land.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p>There is much frankness in this explanation
inasmuch as it was the difficulty of marrying their
daughters in a way they considered properly that
encouraged the practice. There is no doubt there
had been a persistent warfare in the formative
periods of the tribes, and when the warlike conditions
made it impossible to marry the daughters
advantageously, the daughters become a burden
with the result that the practice of infanticide
sprang up.</p>

<p>“The practice which prevailed in Europe,” says
Colonel Walker, “and chiefly amongst the princi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>pal
families, of placing their daughters in nunneries,
might be traced to the same motives that led
the Jharejas to put theirs to death; and both have
originated in the desire of diminishing the cares
and expense attending a numerous family.”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p>That the practice, no matter how deeply rooted
in the tribe, still leaves the decision with the father,
is shown from the following explanation of putting
the child to death:</p>

<p>“When the wives of the Jhareja are delivered
of daughters, the women who may be with the
mother repair to the oldest man in the house; this
person desires them to go to him who is the father
of the infant, and do as he directs. On this the
women go to the father, who desires them to do as
is customary, and so to inform the mother. The
women then repair to the mother, and tell her to
act in conformity to their usages. The mother
next puts opium on the nipple of her breast, which
the child, inhaling with its milk, dies. The above
is one custom, and the following is another: when
the child is born, they place the navel string on its
mouth, when it expires.”<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>We are further informed that “if a father wishes
to preserve a daughter, he previously apprises his
wife and family, and his commands are obeyed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
if a mother entertains the wish of preserving a
daughter, and her husband is averse to it, the
infant must be put to death.”<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<p>The heads of the tribes were consulted. Many
of them declared that the women and children were
well treated and pointed out the fact that the
Hindu religion has always protected the female
sex from violence and that it was unlawful to put
a woman to death for any offence whatsoever. In
support of this they quote the following Sloke verse,
which is extracted from the Dhurma Shastra:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Shut Gao Vudhet Veepra;</div>
<div class="line">Shut Veepra Vudhet Streeya;</div>
<div class="line">Shut Streeya Vudhet Bala;</div>
<div class="line">Shut Bala Vudhet Mroosha.”</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“To kill 100 cows is equal to killing a Brahmin;</div>
<div class="line">To kill 100 Brahmins is equal to killing a woman;</div>
<div class="line">To kill 100 women is equal to killing a child;</div>
<div class="line">To kill 100 children is equal to telling an untruth.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Walker also came across a tribe of Brahmins
called Kurada. Their object of worship was a
goddess known as Makalukshmee to whom human
sacrifice was acceptable. Another name for their
deity was Vishara Bhoot, a spirit of poison, a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
amiable ghost inasmuch as it led to the poisoning
of guests as sacrifices for this queen of another
world.</p>

<p>Among these people the following story was told
as giving the origin of the sacrifices of human
beings:</p>

<p>“A certain Raja, having built a spacious and
beautiful tank, found every effort to fill it with
water impracticable.</p>

<p>“This greatly distressed the Raja, and having in
vain exerted every expedient of devotion and labour
the Raja at last vowed to his particular deity the
sacrifice of his own child, provided this precious
offering was accepted by the grant of his prayer.</p>

<p>“Accordingly the Raja directed one of his
children to be placed in the centre of the tank, on
which the deity instantly gave an undeniable
testimony of his assent and gratification; the tank
immediately filled with fine water, and the child
was sacrificed in being drowned.”<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<p>The records of the correspondence and the engagements
for the next eighty years make interesting
reading, especially the communications
from the various princes protesting that inasmuch
as they had killed their daughters for 4900 years
it was an unfriendly act for the British Government
to interfere with the practice or insist on discussing
it. Showing their humanity and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
<i>right</i> to be protected from interference in the matter
of female infanticide, the Futteh Mahommed
Jemadar, writing to Colonel Walker, protests that
already “in this country, neither birds nor animals
are killed, goats excepted, and but few even eat
them; and charitable places for fakirs going and
coming from Mecca, and Hindus performing pilgrimages,
are so strongly planted that they suffer
no annoyance.”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p>In an interesting batch of correspondence, 1835,
between the British political agent, J. P. Willoughby,
at Kattywar and various Jhallas, Rawuls,
Gohuls, and Surwyejas of this section of India,
these sub-chiefs reply to the half-cajoling, half-commanding
communications of the political
agent that they will do their best to see that infanticide
is stopped, plaintively informing the representatives
of the British Government that in
addition they will promise to bring up their
own daughters. “Five months since,” says the
Jhareja Dosajee, Chief of Paal, appealingly,
“my brother, Jhareja Hurreebhyee, got a daughter,
which he preserved. This I wrote for your
information.”</p>

<p>In the brief time since 1835 there is evident the
great change that has come over the spirit of the
once proud sons of the East. The iron of the West
has left its mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>The Infanticide Act, No. 366 A, 14th of March
1871, organized and equalized the work and showed
that the government was indeed resolved “to use
every means in its power to eradicate the inhuman
practice that any relaxation of the repressive
measures now to be enforced will depend on the
evidence that may be given of a disposition to
reform.” Copies of the proclamation were affixed
in conspicuous places at each <i>tehseelee</i>, police
station, and village <i>chopal</i> in the proclaimed localities
and with the employment of the registrar of
midwives, the imposition of extra police under certain
circumstances, and the fact that midwife and
Chowkidar were both obliged to report where the
proportion of the girls to the child population falls
below twenty-five per cent.,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> an effectual check
was put on the practice of several thousand years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>SEMITIC DEVELOPMENT IN CANAAN—SACRIFICE OF THE
FIRST-BORN PERSISTS—ORIGIN OF THE IDEA OF
SACRIFICE—THE CUSTOM WORLD-WIDE AMONG
PRIMITIVE PEOPLES—ASSOCIATED WITH CANNIBALISM—THE
FOUNDATION SACRIFICE—DISCOVERIES
IN PALESTINE.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N treating of the Semitic race—a race that gave
to humanity the Bible and the Koran, a race
that founded Judaism, Christianity, and Islamism—its
attitude will be better understood if we
approach it through the tribes whose religions and
humanitarian ideas were eventually to become
the religions and humanitarian ideas of the civilized
world.</p>

<p>The beginning of the nation of Israel was the
result of the frequent immigration into Palestine of
Semites who fused with the aborigines and formed
the Phœnician or Canaanitish people. From the
time of Lugalzaggisi (about 4000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>) there were
successive Babylonian immigrations also, and from
1500 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> onward there were added to this mixture
the Aramean tribes that had previously inhabited
the highlands between the Mesopotamian Valley
and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
nomads, the Israelites after settling in Canaan
became excellent agriculturists,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> and there developed
the worship of Yahweh—“the worship of no
other god contributing to the sum of humanity’s
ethical ideas and spiritual conceptions a tithe of
the value of that contributed by the worshippers
of Yahweh.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<p>These nomadic Semites when they settled in
Palestine about 1000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, after years of wandering,
had many of the characteristics of a highly cultivated
people but they also had the habits of the
nomadic people that had originally come out of
Arabia. Many too were the lapses into the ways
of primitive people during the four hundred years
of their wandering after their life in Goshen.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<p>If, as has been said, three generations without
education would reduce the civilized peoples of
today to savagery, the proneness of the Semites
to fall back into godless ways may be well understood;
so too one may well understand the protests
and lashings of the prophets who saw their people
retrograding.</p>

<p>When the Israelites began to write their own
history they were a highly developed race in which
there were few traces of early savagery, but the
habit of sacrificing the firstling was a remnant of
earlier economic stress that had passed into their
religion. In order to understand the Israelite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
branch of the Semitic race and how it was possible
for it to produce, on the one hand, the humanitarian
ideas that rule the world today, when at
practically the same time its leaders were protesting
against savage sacrifices, but a step removed from
cannibalism, one can do no better than to quote
the eloquent and learned Chwolson, though his
theory of the innate quality of a race is open to
serious objections.</p>

<p>Commenting on the fundamental causes of the
peculiarities of a people, one of which he says is the
nature of “its heart and nervous system,” he thus
describes the disposition of the Israelites<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>:</p>

<p>“In reference to the disposition (Gemueth) and
organization of the nervous system: the Semite
possesses a deep, easily excitable disposition, and
is capable of mighty feelings; he is, therefore,
lively, mobile, easily excited, passionate, quickly
enthused for an idea, active and enterprising,
flexible and adapting, easily finding himself at
home in strange relations and circumstances,
accommodating himself to them without difficulty,
without, however, allowing of being absorbed by
them.”</p>

<p>While, therefore, some of the Israelites developed
in humanitarianism and poetry and religion, under
the favourable conditions in Canaan, others, under
various other influences, reverted to former practices.
Among these practices was that of sacrificing
the first-born child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>To understand better how the people who gave
to the world the Child’s Friend retained so late the
habit of sacrificing children, the scope of the
custom must be understood.</p>

<p>The sacrifice of human beings to the gods, says
Grimm,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> rested on the supposition that human
food was agreeable to the gods and not until man
had advanced did the idea come that substitutes
might be offered. In the cannibalistic stage of
development these sacrifices were eaten by the
sacrificers, thus establishing a connecting link
between the humans and the invisible gods whom
they hoped to appease.</p>

<p>The whole theory of sacrifice will be better
understood if we grasp the fact that it was born of
fear. When a nation sacrificed out of gratitude or
in apparent joyous exultation, it was in memory of
days when they suffered and their gratitude was
as much a propitiation as anything else. Born in
fear, the next step in the development of sacrifice
was to economize “without impairing efficiency.”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>
The result of this second effort is seen in ingenious
devices by which the burden on the worshipper is
lightened by his substituting something less valuable
than what he is supposed to offer, or what
the god is supposed to want, but which the worshipper
believes will be acceptable. These substitutions
are always made when the forces of
nature are treating man more kindly and when his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
attitude toward his gods is less fearful, for the
mind of man in time of plenty and security has
always presupposed that time to be when the gods
are more or less drowsy.</p>

<p>With some primitive peoples, the sacrifice began
as an offering of a meal to the ancestor who had
gone before, but as with all primitive peoples the
determining factor in religion is fear rather than
affection, it became a method of soliciting favours
for the future, and such were the sacrifices among
the Greeks and Romans, the Hebrews, the Aryans,
and the Chinese.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p>Primitive man, when unwelcome children were
born, found easy excuse for getting rid of them by
offering them as a sacrifice to the impatient and
fearful gods. That at some stage in the development
of the parental instinct the excuse that the
gods must be propitiated was needed to quiet the
awakening mother love, is more than likely.
And surely, no more crushing answer could there
be to the request to allow a child to live than that
the gods were angry and had to be propitiated.</p>

<p>Another reason given for offering children was
that, having just come from the other world, they
were nearer to the gods and freer of sin and therefore
more acceptable. Such reasoning argues a
stage far in advance of the cannibal who ate his
own children under the idea that he was propitiating
an angry god. “The institutions of man de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>velop
with considerable uniformity all over the
globe, although as races advance, they naturally
diverge more or less under the influence of different
climate, food, and other conditions.”<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> Cannibalism
was one of the earliest stages to which we are
able to trace many of the customs even of today,
and the idea of sacrifice of children undoubtedly
had its origin in primitive cannibalistic feasts,
“ceremonies that were softened by the rise of civilization
as well as migration to more fertile land
and an abundance of food sufficient to make the
substitution of an animal for a human possible.”<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></p>

<p>Among primitive people the sacrifice of children
is common. In most cases there is some specific
result that is desired when the child is sacrificed.
In the Tonga Islands in the South Pacific, the
sacrifice of the child is called <i>nawgia</i> and strangling
is the method adopted, whenever it is found that
the ordinary cures do not affect some sick parent.
It is said that the natives watch the ceremony of
strangling with much pity but that they feel it is
better “to sacrifice a child who is at present of no
use to society, and perhaps may not otherwise live
to be,” than to allow a sick chief to die.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> On one
occasion when the gods had been offended the
native priests decreed that the child of Toobo
Toa, the chief, should be sacrificed, “on such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
occasions the child of a male chief being always
chosen as being worthier than others,” and a two-year-old
child was strangled against the protests of
its mother, who tried to conceal it.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<p>That the health of the Ynca also led to sacrifice
of children is stated by Acosta:</p>

<p>“They vsed in Peru to sacrifice yong children
of foure or six yeares old vnto tenne; and the greatest
parte of these sacrifices were for the affaires
that did import the Ynca, as in sickness for his
health, and when he went to the warres for victory,
or when they gave the wreathe to their new Ynca,
which is the marke of a King, as heere the Scepter
and the Crowne be. In this solemnitie they sacrificed
the number of two hundred children, from
foure to tenne yeares of age, which was a cruell and
inhumane spectacle. The manner of the sacrifice
was to drowne them and bury them with
certaine representations and ceremonies; sometimes
they cutte off their heads, annointing themselves
with the blood from one eare to another.”<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></p>

<p>Acosta also declared that when an ordinary man
was sick and believed he would die, his own son
was sacrificed to the Sun or to Virachoca.</p>

<p>Francisco de Jerez says that the Peruvian Indians
sacrificed their own children and tinted the
doors of their temples and the faces of their idols
with the blood.</p>

<p>“They sacrifice each month their own children,
and with their blood smear the faces of the idols
and the doors of the temples, and sprinkle the
blood over the graves of their dead.”<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<p>It is certain, according to the story of Sieur le
Moyne de Mourgues, that “in that part of Florida
which is near Virginia,—and where the French are
under the leadership of Sieur le Laudonnière—the
people of this country regard their chiefs as sons
of the Sun and, for this reason, they pay them
divine honours, sacrificing to them their first-born.”<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></p>

<p>“Their custom is,” according to Le Moyne, “to
offer up the first-born son to the chief. When
the day for the sacrifice is notified to the chief, he
proceeds to a place set apart for the purpose,
where there is a bench for him on which he takes
his seat. In the middle of the area before him is
a wooden stump two feet high and as many thick,
before which a mother sits on her heels, her face
covered in her hands, lamenting the loss of her
child. The principal one of her female relatives or
friends now offers the child to the chief in worship,
after which the women who have accompanied the
mother form a circle and dance around with
demonstrations of joy, but without joining hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
She who holds the child goes and dances in the
middle, singing some praises to the chief. Meanwhile,
six Indians, chosen for the purpose, take
their stand in a certain place in the open area;
and midway among them the sacrificing officer,
who is decorated with a sort of magnificence, and
holds a club. The ceremony being through, the
sacrificer takes the child and slays it in honour of
the chief, before them all, upon the wooden stump.
This offering was, on one occasion, performed in
our presence.”<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>“It was the Custom in Peru, to sacrifice Children
from four to ten Years of Age, which was
chiefly done when the Inga was sick, or going to
War, to pray for Victory, and at the Coronation
of those Princes they sacrific’d two hundred
Children. Sometimes they strangl’d, and bury’d
them, and other times they cut their Throats, and
the Priests besmear’d themselves with the Blood
from Ear to Ear, which was the Formality of the
Sacrifice. Nor were the Virgins (<i>Mamaconas</i>) of
the Temple exempt from being sacrific’d and,
when any Person of Note was sick, and the Priest
said he must die, they sacrific’d his son, desiring
the Idol to be satisfied with him, and not take away
his Father’s life. The Ceremonies us’d at this
Sacrifice were strange, for they behav’d themselves
like mad Men. They believ’d that all Calamities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
were occasion’d by Sin, and that Sacrifices were
the Remedy.”<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>Further evidence of the attitude of the Indians
is given by the first secretary of the Colony of
Virginia Brittania, who asserted that the Indians
in Florida sacrificed the first-born male child.
According to this writer, their Quiyoughquisocks,
or prophets to the Indians, persuaded the warriors
to resist the settlements of the white people because
their Okeus, who was god of the tribe, would
not be appeased by the sacrifice of a thousand
children if they permitted the white people, who
despised their religion, to dwell among them.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>In parts of New South Wales<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> such as Bathurst,
Goulburn, the Lachlan, or MacQuarie, the first-born
of every <i>lubra</i> was eaten by the tribe as a
part of the religious ceremony. Here, too, it was
the male infant that was more desirable as a sacrifice,
the female infants being sometimes allowed to
live. In this connection, it is interesting to note
that where children are killed without any other
excuse than that they are a drain on the resources
of their parents, it is the female children who are
slaughtered. When, however, there is a so-called
religious reason for the infanticide, it is the male
child that suffers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>In India, as we shall see, children were frankly
killed for economic reasons; but here too there are
evidences of the sacrifice theory. Up to the beginning
of the present century, the custom of offering
a first-born child to the Ganges was common.
A custom akin to this was that of the Ganga Jatra,
the murder of sick relatives on the banks of the
sacred river. As late as 1812, a mother and sister
burned a leper at Katwa near Calcutta, their excuse
being that by so doing he would be given a
pure body in the next world.</p>

<p>Women, too, who had been long barren dedicated
their first child, if one were given them, to
Omkar Mandharta.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<p>Bathing in blood, especially the blood of children,
in Northern India was regarded as a powerful
remedy for disease. In 1870, a Mussulman
butcher, losing his child, was told by a Hindu
conjurer that in order to make the next child
healthy, he should wash his wife in the blood of a
boy, with the result that a child was murdered.
At Muzaffar Nagar a child was killed and the blood
drunk by a barren woman.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></p>

<p>In the city of Saugor in India, human sacrifices
were offered up in the year 1800, when they were
stopped by the local governor, Assa Sahib, although
the Brahmin priests objected strenuously
to the <i>innovation</i>. Outside the city, there was a
spot where the young men sacrificed themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
in order to fulfil the vows of their mothers. The
belief was that when a woman was without a child,
she could overcome barrenness by promising her
first-born, if a male, to the god of destruction,
Mahadea. If a boy was born after this vow, she
concealed from him the vow until he attained the
age of puberty, when it was his duty to obey his
mother’s call and throw himself, at the annual fair
on the sandstone hills, from a perpendicular height
of four or five hundred feet and be dashed to pieces
upon the rocks below.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>Among the Banjarilu, a caste of travelling traders
noted in “Bhadrachellam and Rekapalli Taluquas,”<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a>
the custom in former years was, before
starting off on a business journey, to procure a
little child and bury it in the ground up to its
shoulders. Then the traders would drive their
loaded bullocks over the victim and in proportion
as the bullocks “thoroughly trampled the child to
death” was their belief in a successful journey increased.
Probably very little credence can be
given to their assertions that they have completely
left off such cruelties.</p>

<p>The Chinese philosopher, Mih Tsze, who lived
about the fourth century before Christ, wrote that
there existed at one time in China a state called
Kai-muh, where it was the custom to kill and de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>vour
the eldest brother as an offering to the gods.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p>We come now to the results of recent excavations
in Palestine.</p>

<p>There were discovered at Gezer, the bodies of
adults that had been sacrificed at foundation rites
and deposited with the corner-stones much as
moderns deposit mementoes and newspapers.
Mr. MacAlister, who had charge of the excavations
at Gezer, says, however, that adult or adolescent
victims were rare in comparison with the number
of infants or very young children whose remains
were found under the corners of houses. Such
deposits were found in all the Semitic strata but
were very rare in the Hellenistic stratum, showing
that the practice died down when the Greeks came
into control of the land. The children sacrificed
at these foundation rites were deposited in the
same manner as those found at the <i>messobath</i>
or high place, where there was discovered a cemetery
of jar-buried infants that went to show how
general was the practice of sacrificing their new-born
infants among the Canaanites.</p>

</div>

<p>“That these sacrificed infants were the first-born,
devoted in the Temple, is indicated by the
fact that none were over a week old. This seems
to show that the sacrifices were not offered under
stress or any special calamity, or at the rites
attaching to any special season of the year. The
special circumstance which led to the selection of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>these infants must have been something inherent
in the victims themselves, which devoted them to
sacrifice from the moment of their birth. Among
various races, various circumstances are regarded
as sufficient reason for infanticide—deformity, the
birth of twins, etc.; but among the Semites the
one cause most likely to have been effective was
primogeniture.”<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p>

<p>In the vessels in which the infants were placed,
were found by the excavators smaller vessels which
were probably food vessels with a viaticum for the
victim.</p>

<p>At Ta’Annek<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> after the discoveries at Gezer,
a cemetery containing some twenty infants, also
buried in jars, was discovered about a rock altar,
the age of the infants that had been sacrificed
having been as much as five years. At Megiddo<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a>
underneath a corner of a temple, there were found
four jars with the bones of children and near them
smaller jars and a bowl, which undoubtedly contained
the food that children were supposed to
need in the other world. Professor Sellin suggests
that the bones found at Tell Ta’Annek
may have been the bones of children that had
died too young to be buried in the family sepulchres,
but the burden of evidence suggests a different
explanation. Here, then, we have a double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
reason for the sacrifice of the children, for the
foundation sacrifices were—one might almost say
<i>are</i>, so recently have there been instances of the
practice—of a different order from the sacrifice
of the first-born.</p>

<p>On these foundation sacrifices, Dr. Driver has
made some interesting notes. We are all familiar
with our own foundation ceremonies, which are
really nothing more or less than a modification of
these primitive ceremonies that consisted almost
entirely of the sacrifice of a human being and in
many instances of an infant, inasmuch as the
infant, having just come into the world, was
purer and nearer to god and therefore more
acceptable. Traces of the custom of sacrificing
a human life in order that some destructive god
or demon might be propitiated and the lives of
those about to occupy the building thereby made
safer are found in India, New Zealand, China,
Japan, Mexico, Germany, and Denmark.</p>

<p>The extent of these foundation sacrifices had
been revealed by Dr. Trumbull in his <i>Threshold
Covenant</i>, all going to show that different branches
of the human family, though far removed, mounted
much the same steps in their endeavour to achieve
the truth about the world in which they lived.</p>

<p>Among the Danes, when the fortifications were
first being built around Copenhagen many years
ago, the walls, as they were built, kept sinking in,
and it did not seem possible that they would ever
stand firmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>“The workmen finally took a little girl, placed
her at a table, and gave her play toys and sweetmeats.
Then, as she sat there enjoying herself,
the masons built an arch over her and in this way
the walls were made solid.”<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>A similar story is told<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> of a castle of Liebenstein.
It was made fast and impregnable by buying a
child from its mother and walling it in.</p>

<p>Slavensk, a Slavonic town on the Danube, had
been devastated by the plague and when it was
built anew the wise men of the town agreed that
there must be a human victim. Messengers were
sent out before sunrise to seize the first living
creature they met. The victim was a child and it
was buried alive under the foundation stone of the
citadel, and from that time on, a citadel was called
a Dyetinet, from Dyetina<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>, a child.</p>

<p>In Africa in Galam, Tylor says<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> that a boy and a
girl were buried alive before the gate of the city
in order to make it impregnable. In other places,
such as Great Bassam and Yarriba, such sacrifices
were usual even when the foundation was only
that of a house.</p>

<p>In some places, such as among the Tantis of
Africa, the sacrifice was made at every new moon.
In Sargos, a girl was offered up that there might be
good crops. In Bonny, they sacrificed every year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
a beautiful virgin to Juju that the evil spirits might
be kept away.</p>

<p>“The connection between cannibalism and
human sacrifice,” says Dr. Waitz, “is manifest
enough in the festivals of Dahomey.”<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>

<p>There were two principal and solemn sacrifices
among the Pipiles, a Maya people in Central
America—one at the commencement of summer
and one at the beginning of winter. Little boys of
ten and twelve years of age were the victims, and
their blood was sprinkled in the direction of the
four cardinal points.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<p>Among the Milanau Dyaks when the largest
house was being erected, a deep hole was dug and
a slave girl was placed in it. An enormous timber
was then allowed to descend on her and crush her
to death.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></p>

<p>As late as 1843 in Germany, when a new bridge
was being built at Halle, the common people
fancied that a child was wanted to be walled into
the foundations. According to Grimm, the tower
called the Reichenfels Castle was built on a live
child and a projecting stone marks the place. If
that were pulled out, the wall, it is said, would
tumble down.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<p>According to a Servian legend, three hundred
masons laboured for three years at the foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
stones of Scutari, but what they built by day, the
<i>Vila</i> tore down at night. At last she made known
to the kings that the place would never be finished
until two brothers or sisters “of like name” were
built into the foundations. Nowhere could such
be found. Then the <i>Vila</i> required that one of the
wives of the kings should be walled up in the
ground. The next day the consort of the youngest
king, never dreaming of such a decree, brought out
some dinner to the workmen; thereupon the three
hundred masons dropped their stones around her
and began to wall her in. At her entreaty, they
left a small opening and there she continued to
suckle her babe who was held up to her once a day.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></p>

<p>The foundation sacrifice is well known in India.
At Madras, it has long been a tradition that when
the fort was first built a girl was built into it to
render it impregnable.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> A Raja was once building
a bridge over the river Jargo at Chunar and when it
fell down several times, he was advised to sacrifice
a Brahman girl to the local deity. She has now
become the <i>Mari</i> or ghost of the place and is
regularly worshipped in time of trouble. In
Kumaun, there are professional kidnappers known
as Doqhutiya, or two-legged beasts of prey, who
go about capturing boys that they may be used in
foundation sacrifices.</p>

<p>Up to 1867, when a house was built among the
Tlinkits tribe in Alaska, the relatives and friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of the chief or wealthy man were invited to appear
on the spot that he had chosen for the site. Addressing
them at great length, he referred with
pride to the various deeds of his ancestors and
promised to so conduct himself as to shed more lustre
on the family name. The space for the house
was then cleared, a spot for the fireplace designated,
and four holes dug wherein the corner posts were
to be set. A slave, or the descendant of a slave
who had been captured in war, was then blind-folded
and compelled to lie down face uppermost
on the spot selected for the fireplace. A sapling
was then cut, laid across the throat of the slave,
and, at a given signal, the two nearest relatives of
the house sat upon the respective ends of the sapling,
thereby choking the wretch to death.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

the civilization of the world was there the same
spirit that there was in that outlandish corner of

from Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Mesopotamian,
Chinese, and Indian philosophies as we have been
able to judge of them in the writing of the civilizations
they produced. If, to make one more comparison,

the Israelites were passionately human. “The

<p>According to these writings, Abraham, the
eponymic father of the Israelites, was tested in his
loyalty to Yahweh by being told to take his son
Isaac into the land of Moriah, a district in Palestine,
and there sacrifice him as a burnt offering.
In the land of Canaan at the time the Jahvist and
the Elohist wrote of this temptation, the ceremony
of sacrificing the first-born of a living thing was
still practised; among the neighbouring peoples—the
Phœnicians on one side and the Sabeans on
the south-east—children were still sacrificed. The
Elohist therefore was anxious to show that a
thousand or more years back, in the time of the
founder of their race, it was not the custom of the
tribe to sacrifice children and that it was only
done when the Lord gave the especial command.</p>

<small>(FROM A PAINTING BY J. S. COPLEY, R. A.)</small></div>
</div>

<p>With Abraham the command, while painful, was
apparently not surprising. He went about the
execution in a businesslike way, only to find when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>he was about to sacrifice the boy, that the Lord
was satisfied with his display of zeal and did not
intend the command to be carried out. Then
“Abraham lifted up his eyes, and behold, behind
him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns: and
Abraham went and took the ram and offered him
up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.”<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></p>

<p>Here was the first case of substitution, in which
the early writer testifies that not only was the
substitution satisfactory to the deity, but the
human sacrifice was forbidden and an animal providentially
provided that the ceremony of sacrifice
might be gone through without loss of human
blood. However strong the popular inclination
to accept the bloody rites of the religion of the
surrounding tribes, from that time there was a
fixed standard to which the prophets and true
believers of Israel held—human sacrifice had been
stopped by the Lord himself.</p>

<p>Among the Assyrians also, father Orhan was
represented as having substituted an animal for
human beings, the Assyrian patriarch being represented
as a man of benevolent aspect, seated in an
armchair without any sort of military pomp or
circumstance.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<p>To make the substitution of an animal for a
human being more effective, and more popular,
Abraham entered into a covenant with Yahweh
by which the deity was still given the blood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
humans without a life being sacrificed. The rite
of circumcision is the substitution commanded by
Yahweh himself:</p>

<p>“This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between
me and thee, and thy seed after thee;
Every man child among you shall be circumcised.”<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></p>

<p>This rite, mixed as it is with phallic worship
(see Genesis), had its origin in the castration of
prisoners of war,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> and, as far as the Israelites were
concerned, probably originated in Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> although
it has been found to be performed among
the tribes of Central Australia with a stone knife
just as is recorded of the Israelites. With progress
and the fact that use was found for prisoners,
castration gave way to marking the prisoners, until
the original significance passing, as among the
Egyptians according to Herodotus, the practice
became one of purely hygienic value.</p>

<p>That this covenant with Yahweh was kept
when all about them the first-born children of the
Egyptians were sacrificed, the feast of the Passover
(from חטם, <i>pesach</i>, meaning “to pass by,
to spare”) attests. Yahweh told Moses that he
was to claim the lives of not only the first-born of
the Egyptians “from the first-born of Pharaoh
that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the
captive that was in the dungeon,” but also the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>first-born of all the animals in the land. That the
chosen people might not suffer in this contemplated
destruction they were instructed, through Moses,
to take the blood of a lamb, “a male of the first
year,” and “strike it on the two side-posts and on
the upper door-post of the houses,” that it might
be known wherein the faithful dwelt.</p>

<div class="caption">A NOTABLE CASE OF ABANDONMENT—THE FINDING OF MOSES<br /><br />

<small>(AFTER PAINTING BY SCHOPIN)</small></div>
</div>

<p>Here we see the beginning of the threshold sacrifice
or covenant, which became, in time, the
foundation sacrifice.</p>

<p>So complete was this claiming of the first-born
that “there was not a house where there was not
one dead.”<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p>From their deliverance from this visitation,
Yahweh instructed Moses to “sanctify unto me
all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb
among the children of Israel; both of man and
beast, it is mine.” Already there was the example
of the patriarch Abraham that an animal might be
substituted; now there was the statement from the
One on high that the first-born of the chosen people
might be redeemed. Of the temper of the people
at this time and their proneness to fall into the
vices of their neighbours, and of idolatry, we need
only the statement of Joshua<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> that while in
Egypt—Renan says that they were not there more
than three hundred years—they acquired the habit
of worshipping false gods.</p>

<p>The speedy fall from grace, as shown by the
worship of the golden calf while Moses was away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
from them for a short time, is another evidence
of their excitability, although modern scientists
have declared that under adverse circumstances
the entire civilized peoples would revert to barbarity
in three generations.</p>

<p>The struggle upward out of barbarism could
have been attended with nothing less than herculean
belief on the part of the leaders of Israel,
when we see this lapse came after their miraculous
escape from Egypt and after the receipt of the ten
commandments. Illuminating too is the fact
that the making of the golden calf was superintended
by no less a person than Aaron, the brother
of Moses, his confidant and first lieutenant.</p>

<p>When we come to the period of the Judges, we
find the Israelites falling away from their humanitarianism.
While Joshua and his contemporaries
were alive, they held to their religion, but the gods
of Canaan, together with the more easily understood
and more deeply ingrained rites of idolatry,
reappeared as soon as the patriarchs had passed
away.</p>

<p>Nothing indeed is more interesting in this study
of the Old Testament than the record of the
difficulty that the leaders and prophets had in
keeping a semi-barbarous people up to their standard
of civilization and humanization. Ethnological
and archæological data picture the struggle
forward but feebly, when compared to the written
records of the Israelites, especially during the period
of the Judges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p>The period of the Judges was the period of the
formation of the nation, and had there not been
all around them reminders of their own previous
nomadic habits, and had they been a less excitable
people, there would not have been the recurrence
to barbaric traits that we find. Even then, the
progress of the Israelites in humanitarianism is
unique in the world. From the settlement in
Canaan, which was about 1200 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, until the
birth of Christ, they suffered conquest, disintegration,
and many afflictions, but progressed steadily
in humanitarianism. In that time the Greeks rose
and fell, achieving great intellectual and æsthetic
perfection, but failing to even approach the Israelites
in humanity. A few hundred years after the
settlement in Canaan, the Romans appear as a
civilized people and, aided by a transplanted stoicism,
developed a great humanitarianism under the
Emperors Trajan and Hadrian; the last named,
however, despite his greatness, indissolubly linked
with the degeneracy that was the mark of Greek
self-centredness, or lack of humanity, as Mahaffy
calls it.</p>

<p>The transition from idealism to nationalism is
never affected with impunity, says Renan, and
so the growing nation suffered in its material
growth and through the insistence that Yahweh
“loved Israel and hated all the rest of the world.”<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a>
Baal and Yahweh were not far apart and at Sechem
there was a Baal-berith, or Baal covenant, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the idolators worshipped as Baal, and the Israelites
as Yahweh.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> “If the religion of Israel had not
gone beyond this phase, it is certainly the last
religion to which the world would have rallied.”<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></p>

<p>It is in this period that we have the story of
Jephthah, an outcast, the head of banditti and an
illegitimate son, who was asked by the Israelites
of Gilead to help them against the Ammonites.
Jephthah vowed that if he should be successful he
would sacrifice to Yahweh the first thing that met
him on his return from the campaign, and the
first thing to meet him was his daughter. “And
he sent her away for two months and she went with
her companions and bewailed her virginity upon
the mountains. And it came to pass that at the
end of two months that she returned unto her
father who did with her according to the vow which
he had vowed.”<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></p>

<p>It is suggested by Renan that what probably
happened was that Jephthah, before undertaking
a difficult war, sacrificed one of his daughters
according to the barbarous custom put into practice
on solemn occasions when the country was in
danger. “Patriarchal deism,” he says, “had condemned
these immolations; Yahwehism with its
exclusively national principle was rather favourable
to them. Not many human sacrifices were
offered to God nor to the Elohim. The gods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
whom they thought to propitiate by means of
human sacrifices were the patriot gods, Camos of
the Moabites, Moloch of the Canaanites, Melqarth
of Carthage.”<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></p>

<p>The coming of David was the triumph of Yahweh
over the contending religions, though, as
modern critics have pointed out, there was little
humanitarianism in the semi-barbarous poet.
When there was a three years’ famine in the land it
was ascribed to the wrong done the Gibeonites by
Saul and the Gibeonites were allowed to say what
should be the sacrifice to atone for the wrong. The
ancient historian records the fact that they asked
that they might be allowed to hang the seven sons
of Saul, and this was done. The sacrifice was asked
for by the Gibeonites and it was for the purpose of
ending the famine, but, incidentally, it enabled
David to get rid of those who stood in his way.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<p>A few hundred years later, in the ninth century,
we find the effect of the sacrifice of the first-born
telling on the Israelites even though at that time
it is evident that they themselves have given up
human sacrifice. Jehoram, King of Israel, and
Jehosophat, King of Judah, united to defeat the
remarkable King of Moab, Mesha. The combined
forces drove him within his strong fortifications of
Kir-Haraseth and when he found that there was
no way of escape, as a last resort:</p>

<p>“He took his eldest son, that should have reigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering
upon the wall. And they [the Israelites] departed
from him and returned to their own land.”</p>

<p>The efficacy of the sacrifice is hereby admitted
although it was offered to Camos and not to Yahweh.
The ancient historian says nothing in extenuation
of the effect. Ewald suggests that Yahweh,
full of bitterness<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> against Israel for having driven
the King of Moab to such a deed of fearful bravery,
filled the army full of terror. Renan, however,
suggests that though they did not then offer human
sacrifices themselves, the Israelites still had the
fullest faith in their efficacy and retired lest they
be defeated.</p>

<p>Coming nearer, to a period that is contemporaneous
with that which is revealed in the excavations
at Gezer and Tell Ta’Annek, we have the direct
statement in Kings and Chronicles<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> that Ahaz,
the eleventh King of Judah (about 741 to 725 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>),
“made his son pass through the fire.” To gain
the aid of Tiglath-Pileser against the Edomites and
the Philistines he became a vassal of the Assyrian
monarch and his name appears among the names
of those who acknowledged his sovereignty and
paid tribute.</p>

<p>Manasseh was another King of Judah (697 to
642 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>) who sacrificed his son,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> emulating Ahaz
in this as in other heathenish customs, increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
the popularity of the foreign gods and causing the
streets of Jerusalem to run with the blood of
the prophets whom he put to death. In every
way he tried to make the heathen religions more
acceptable and accessible to the whole nation by
providing them with temples and altars. In
addition to sacrificing one of his own sons to Moloch,
he revived that religion on a large scale,
building for it a magnificent burning place (Tophet)
in the valley of Hinnom on the southern wall
of Jerusalem. The tortures to which the children
were subjected soon associated themselves in the
minds of the pious with what punishment beyond
the grave must be like, so that the name of hell
itself was taken from this valley, Ge-Hinnom.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></p>

<p>With the reforms of Josiah we hear no more of
such treatment of children but we must not suppose
that while barbarous practices were going on
the prophets had remained silent. The latter day
writers revolted against the entire idea of sacrifice,
Hosea declaring: “I desired mercy and not sacrifice;
and the knowledge of Yahweh more than
burnt offerings.”<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> Jeremiah even declared that
the Lord had not commanded the people to sacrifice
when they came forth from Egypt:</p>

<p>“For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded
them in the day that I brought them out
of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings
or sacrifices.”<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<p>To Micah, however, it was reserved to express
in those early days the vigorous protest that was
to become the ethical keynote of the future
religion:</p>

<p>“Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and
bow myself before the high God? Shall I come
before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a
year old?</p>

<p>“Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of
rams, or with ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I
give my first son for my transgression, the fruit of
my body for the sin of my soul?</p>

<p>“He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good;
and what doth the Lord require of thee but to do
justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with
thy God?”<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>ANCIENT ARABIANS WERE CANNIBALISTIC—DAUGHTERS
TOO EXPENSIVE TO REAR—CONDITIONS BEFORE
THE COMING OF THE PROPHET—THE INJUNCTIONS
OF MOHAMMED—HIS LAW AS FOUND IN “AL
HIDAYA.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>F the one remaining tribe of the Semites, a
name that has meant so much to the civilization
of the world, it is hardly necessary to
offer a prelude. Coming, however, in the mouth
of the defenders of the latest religion and as the
youngest of the Semitic languages, it is necessary
to say of the Arabic language that it is nearer akin
than any of the others to the original archetype,
the <i>Ursemitisch</i>, from which they are all derived;
“just as the Arabs, by reason of their geographical
situation and the monotonous uniformity of the
desert life, have, in some respects, preserved the
Semitic character more purely and exhibited it
more distinctly than any people of the same
family.”<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>

<p>Arabic history divides itself into three periods,
first the Sabean and Himyarite period, from 800
<span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, the date of the oldest south Arabic inscription;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
second, the Pre-Islamic period, 500 to 622 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>;
and third, the Mohammedan period, beginning
with the Flight, or Hijra (or Hegira). Of the
first periods the little that we know except the
inscriptions coming to us by tradition is preserved
in the Pre-Islamic poems and the Koran.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>The second period is known as the Jahiliyya, or
Age of Ignorance or Barbarism, and, in the ample
remnant of the poetry of that day, we are enabled
“to picture the life of those wild days in its larger
aspects, accurately enough.”<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></p>

<p>The pagan Arabs had long been in the habit of
burying their infant daughters alive, the excuse
offered being that it cost too much to marry them
and that their lives were too closely attended with
the possibility of disgrace “if they should happen
to be made captives or to become scandalous by
their behaviour.”<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> For these reasons there was
never any disguising the fact that the birth of a
daughter was considered a great misfortune and
the death of one a great happiness.</p>

<p>According to one authority, the method em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>ployed
by the Arabs to get rid of the female
infant was to have the mother who was about to
give birth to a child lie down by a pit when she
was about to deliver the child, and if it was a
daughter, it was thrown into the pit without any
more ado.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></p>

<p>Another version is that when a daughter was
born the father, if he intended to keep her, would
have her clothed in a garment of wool or hair as an
indication that later he intended to have her keep
camels or sheep in the desert. If, on the other
hand, he intended to do away with her, he would
allow her to live until she was six years of age, and
then said to her mother:</p>

<p>“Perfume her and adorn her, that I may carry
her to her mothers.”</p>

<p>This being done, he led her to a well or pit that
had previously been dug for that purpose, pushed
her into it, and then, filling the pit, levelled it
with the rest of the ground. It does not seem that
the latter practice could have been other than
rare.</p>

<p>Al Mostatraf is quoted by Sale as saying that
these practices were common throughout Arabia,
and that the tribes of Koreish and Kendah were
particularly notorious in this respect. The members
of the former tribe were in the habit of burying
their daughters alive in Mount Abu Dalama, near
Mecca.</p>

<p>Among the Pre-Islamitic Arabians, the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
of Tamim were noted for their addiction to this
practice and claimed, in after years, that it was
brought about by the action of their chief, Qays,
who was a contemporary of the Prophet. According
to this story, Moshamraj the Yashkorite descended
on the camp of Qays and carried off, among
other women, the daughter of the sister of Qays.
This captive was assigned to the son of Moshamraj,
and when her uncle appeared to ransom her, she
declined to leave her new-found husband. Qays
was so incensed over this action that, on returning
home, he is said to have killed all of his daughters
by burying them alive, and never thereafter allowed
another daughter to live.</p>

<p>During his absence some time later, his wife
gave birth to a daughter, and knowing the feeling
of the father she sent the infant to some relatives
to have the child raised in secrecy. When Qays
returned home she told him that she had given
birth to a dead child.</p>

<p>Years after, when the child had grown up, she
came to visit her mother and while the two were
together they were discovered by Qays.</p>

<p>“I came in,” related Qays himself to Mohammed,
“and saw the girl; her mother had
plaited her hair, and put rings in the side locks
and strung them with sea shells and put on a
chain of cowries, and given her a necklace of dried
dates. I said:</p>

<p>“‘Who is this pretty girl?’ and her mother wept
and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>“‘She is your daughter’; and told me how she
had saved her alive.</p>

<p>“So I waited until the mother ceased to be
anxious about her; then I led her out one day,
dug a pit and laid her in it, she crying:</p>

<p>“‘Father, what are you doing with me?’</p>

<p>“Then I covered her up with the earth and still
she cried:</p>

<p>“‘Father, are you going to bury me? Are you
going to leave me alone and go away?’ But I
went on filling in the earth till I could hear her
cries no longer, and that is the only time that I
felt any pity when I buried a daughter.”<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<p>There were others however before Qays who did
not take this attitude toward children. Sa’sa’a,
the grandfather of the poet Al-Farazdac, frequently
redeemed female children that were about
to be buried alive. Inasmuch as he too was of the
tribe of Tamim his action would indicate that
Qays was not an innovator. In order to save them
he was obliged to buy them off and the price he
paid every time was two she-camels, big with
young, and one he-camel.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></p>

<p>Boasting of this humane action on the part of his
ancestor (who was the François Villon of his day)
Al-Farazdac vauntingly declared one day before
the Khalifs of the family of Omayya:</p>

<p>“I am the son of the giver of life to the dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p>When he was reproved for this boasting he
justified it by quoting the Koran:</p>

<p>“He who saveth a soul alive shall be as if he had
saved the souls of all mankind.”<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<p>The Aghani explains the practice on the ground
of poverty and credits Sa’sa’a with being the first
one to attempt to put an end to the practice.
Thereafter this humane grandparent of a vagabond
poet was known as Muhiyyu’l-Maw’udat, or
“He who brings buried girls to life.” According
to the Kamil he saved as many as one hundred and
eighty daughters.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<p>That infanticide was rare in the desert is the
claim made by defenders of the faith. The following
verses are quoted by Lane as going to show
that the Arabs really had a tender feeling toward
their women and their children; and that infanticide,
which is commonly attributed to the whole
Arab nation of every age before Islam, was in reality
exceedingly rare in the desert, and after almost
dying out only revived about the time of Mohammed.
It was probably adopted by poor and weak
clans, either from inability to support their children,
or in order to protect themselves from the stain
of having their children dishonoured by stronger
tribes, and the occasional practice of this barbarous
and suicidal custom affords no ground for
assuming an unnatural hatred and contempt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
girls among the ancient Arabs. These verses of
a father to his daughter tell a different story:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">If no Umaymah were there, no want would trouble my soul, no labour call me to toil for bread through pitchiest night;</div>
<div class="line">What moves my longing to live is but that well do I know how low the fatherless lies, how hard the kindness of kin.</div>
<div class="line">I quake before loss of wealth lest lacking fall upon her, and leave her shieldless and bare as flesh set forth on a board.</div>
<div class="line">My life she prays for, and I from mere love pray for her death—yea, death, the gentlest and kindest guest to visit a maid.</div>
<div class="line">I fear an uncle’s rebuke, a brother’s harshness for her; my chiefest end was to spare her heart the grief of a word.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Once more, the following lines do not breathe
the spirit of infanticide:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Fortune has brought me down (her wonted way) from station great and high to low estate;</div>
<div class="line">Fortune has rent away my plenteous store: of all my wealth, honour alone is left.</div>
<div class="line">Fortune has turned my joy to tears: how oft did Fortune make me laugh with what she gave!</div>
<div class="line">But for these girls, the Kata’s downy brood, unkindly thrust from door to door as hard,</div>
<div class="line">Far would I roam and wide to seek my bread in earth that has no lack of breadth and length;</div>
<div class="line"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>Nay, but our children in our midst, what else but our hearts are they walking on the ground?</div>
<div class="line">If but the wind blow harsh on one of them, mine eye says no to slumber all night long.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>That the custom was deep-rooted when Mohammed
arrived on the scene is evident from the fact
that Ozaim the Fazarite, according to Abu Tamman,
when he decided to save his daughter Lacita,
had to conceal that fact from his people, although
she was his only child.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<p>Hunger and famine were undoubtedly the main
causes of the practice of getting rid of the female
children, although according to Porphyry a boy
was sacrificed at Dumat-al Jandal<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> and other
Arabs sacrificed a virgin annually.</p>

<p>The cannibalistic strain is re-occurring. In the
year 378 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> a body of Saracens attacking the
Goths before Constantinople gave an example
of this side of the Arabs.</p>

<p>“Both the Goths and the Saracens were parting
on equal terms,” says Ammianus Marcellinus,
when “a strange and unprecedented incident
gave the final advantage to the eastern warriors;
for one of them with long hair, naked—with
the exception of a covering around his waist,—shouting
a hoarse and melancholy cry, drew his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
dagger and plunged into the middle of the Gothic
host, and after he had slain an enemy, put his
lips to his throat and sucked his blood. The barbarians
[the Goths] were terrified at this marvellous
prodigy and from that time forth when they
proceeded on any enterprise, displayed none of
their former and usual ferocity, but advanced
with hesitating steps.”<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></p>

<p>The last line almost leads one to believe that
the wily Arab might have been impelled not so
much by the cannibalistic strain as by cunning
and generalship.</p>

<p>Procopius, in his account of the wars of Justinian,
speaks of the far-off Saracens as anthropophagous,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a>
and according to one Arabian authority at Medina
they licked the blood of the man who had been
killed in blood revenge. Another custom coming
undoubtedly from cannibalistic times is the vow
of the mother to drink wine from the skull of the
slayer of her son.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<p>These were the conditions that Mohammed
undoubtedly ended by his preaching.</p>

<p>“Come, I will rehearse that which your Lord
hath forbidden ye; that is to say that ye be not
guilty of idolatry and that ye show kindness
to your parents and that ye murder not your
children for fear lest ye be reduced to poverty: we
will provide for you and them; and draw not near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
unto heinous crimes, neither openly nor in secret
slay the soul which God hath forbidden you to
slay unless for a just cause.”<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<p>This, Jalal-ad-din says, was revealed at Medina:</p>

<p>“By God, ye shall surely be called to account
for that which ye have falsely devised. They
attributed daughters unto God but unto themselves
children of the sex which they desire. And
when any of them is told the news of the birth of a
female, his face becometh black, and he is deeply
afflicted: he hideth himself from the people, because
of the ill tidings which have been told him; considering
within himself whether he shall keep it
with disgrace, or whether he shall bury it in the
dust.”<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<p>And again he says: “Kill not your children for
fear of being brought to want: we will provide
for them and for you: verily, killing them is a
great sin.” And finally he says: “When the sun
shall be folded up; and when the stars shall fall;
and when the mountains shall be made to pass
away; and when the camels ten months gone with
young shall be neglected; and when the wild beasts
shall be gathered together; and when the seas
shall boil; and when the souls shall be joined again
to their bodies; and when the girl who hath been
buried alive shall be asked for what crime she was
put to death.”<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></p>

<p>Wherever the Arab went, he carried his religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
and his law. And, bloodthirsty as he was in war, it
is to his credit that much was done to check infanticide
wherever the Mussulman reigned. The
extent to which the law on children was regulated
by the Arabs at a time when Europe was in darkness
may be seen in “Al Hidaya,” by Shaykh
Burhan-ad-din Ali, who died <span class="smcap">A.H.</span> 591 and was,
according to his contemporaries, a distinguished
author on jurisprudence.</p>

<p>The Hidaya consists of extracts from a number
of the great works on Mussulman jurisprudence in
which the authorities on different opinions are set
forth together with reasons for preferring any one
adjudication.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> In this work an entire book is devoted
to the <i>Laqeets</i>, which, it is explained, signified,
in the primitive sense, anything lifted from the
ground, but later came to mean an abandoned
child, and, in the law of the Arab, had come to
mean a child that had been cast out from fear of
poverty or for other reasons.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></p>

<p>Here it is stated that, when the finder sees a
<i>Laqeet</i> under circumstances which suppose that if
it is not taken up it may perish, it is not only
praiseworthy to adopt a child, but it is incumbent.</p>

<p>Coming centuries after Christ, it is noteworthy
to observe that Mohammed was able to instil
into his followers such humane doctrines as the
freedom of the foundling and its maintenance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
the funds drawn from the public treasury at a time
when the Christians of Europe were groping vainly
as to the proper treatment of infants.</p>

<p>“A foundling is free,” says the Shaykh Burhan-ad-din
Ali, “because freedom is a quality
originally inherent in man; and the Mussulman
territory in which the infant is found is a territory
of freemen, whence it is also free: moreover, freemen,
in a Mussulman territory, abound more than
slaves, whence the foundling is free, as the smaller
number is dependent to the greater.”<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p>

<p>Christian philosophy offers few more striking
mixtures of humanity and democracy. It was also
the law when the foundling was to be maintained,
the expense of bringing up the child was to be paid
out of the public treasury, and in favor of this law
the opinion of Omar was cited. A very good reason
given for this was that “where the foundling dies
without heirs, his estate goes to the public treasury.”</p>

<p>The person who took up the foundling was
known as a <i>Multaqit</i> and it was the law of
that day that the <i>Multaqit</i> could not exact any
return from the foundling on account of maintenance
except where he had been ordered by the
magistrate to bring up the foundling at its own
expense, in which case the maintenance “is a debt
upon the foundling, because, the magistrate’s
authority being absolute, he is empowered to exact
the return from the foundling.”<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>According to Al-Quduri,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> this was the proper
thing to do as the letting out was regarded as conducive
to the education of the <i>Laqeet</i>. In the Jami
Saghir the hiring out of the foundling was opposed
on the ground that the <i>Multaqit</i> had no right to
turn the faculties of his foundling to his own advantage.
The opinion of Shaykh Burhan-ad-din
Ali was that Al-Quduri was right and that the
child did gain by being let out.</p>

<p>In Al-Siyar there is given a specific injunction
that children must not be slain:</p>

<p>“It does not become Mussulmans to slay women
or children or men that are aged, bed-ridden, or
blind, because opposition and fighting are the only
occasions which make slaughter allowable (according
to our doctors), and such persons are incapable
of these.”<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></p>

<p>In the minute instructions in regard to divorce,
much care is given as to the disposition of a child.
Where the husband and wife separate, the law
was that the child went with the mother, and this
was based on a decision of the Prophet.</p>

<p>“It is recorded that a woman once applied to the
prophet, saying ‘O, prophet of God! this is my
son, the fruit of my womb, cherished in my bosom
and suckled at my breast, and his father is desirous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
of taking him away from me into his own care’; to
which the prophet replied, ‘Thou hast a right in
the child prior to that of thy husband, so long as
thou dost not marry with a stranger.’”<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></p>

<p>If the mother of an infant died, the right of
<i>Hidana</i>, or infant education, rested with the maternal
grandmother. So deeply was this idea imbued
that even if the mother were a hated <i>Zimmi</i> or female
infidel subject, married to a Mussulman, she
was still entitled to the <i>Hidana</i> of her child until the
time when the child was capable of forming a judgment
with respect to religion. When such a time
arrived the child was generally taken from the
mother if she continued to be an infidel, in order
that no injury might come to it from imbibing
the doctrines of a <i>Zimmi.</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>EXPOSURE BY A CIVILIZED PEOPLE—LACK OF HUMANITY
AMONG THE GREEKS—THEIR MYTHOLOGY AN EVIDENCE—CHILDREN
IN HOMER.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HAT the people of the greatest nation of antiquity,
with all their intellect, their subtlety,
their productivity in humanity, art, and
moral ideas, were wanting in heart, is the statement
of one of the greatest scholars of modern times, a
scholar who has also earned the right to be classed
among the admirers and defenders of the Greeks.</p>

<p>“Their humanity,” says Mahaffy, “was spasmodic
and not constant. Their kindness was
limited to friends and family, and included no
chivalry to foes or to helpless slaves. Antiphon,
in speaking of the danger of conviction on insufficient
evidence, mentions the case of the murder of
his master by a slave boy of twelve,”<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> and had
not the slave-boy murderer revealed by his actions
the fact that he was guilty of the deed, the murdered
man’s whole family would have been put
to death on the theory that someone in the family
was guilty of the murder, as the real culprit was too
young, under the law, to be suspected of crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>The Greek’s kindness did not extend to his new-born
children. We shall see later among the
Romans that, from the time of Romulus to the
passing of the Roman Empire, there was an upward
tendency in the attitude of the Romans
toward children. In eight centuries, the Romans
changed, from a people indifferent to the fate of the
newly-born, to a nation over which the humane
Antonines ruled, and ruled successfully.</p>

<p>Among the Greeks, from the time of Homeric
legend, which is supposed to be about 1000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>,
up to the time of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, a period
of over a thousand years, the Greeks changed not
at all in callous indifference as to what became of
that portion of their population that was daily
exposed. Ardent defenders of the Greeks, like
Andrew Lang, see in the fact that little mention
is made in the Homeric legend of the exposure of
female infants, an indication that “Homeric
society with its wealth and its tenderness of heart
would not be so cruel” as to expose little girl
babies.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></p>

<p>Homer says little of children and the only child
to appear directly in the action of the Iliad is the
infant son of Hector and Andromache. “When
Andromache meets Hector as he is hurrying to the
field of battle, the nurse accompanying her carries
in her arms the merry-hearted child, whom
Hector called Scamandrius, but the rest called
him Astyanax (Defender of the City), for Hector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
alone defended Ilium.’”<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> It is true that there
is no example of exposure in Homer, though
Hephaistos says his mother Hera desired to conceal
him because he was lame.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></p>

<p>But why one should expect a tenderness contrary
to the history of the race is difficult to
imagine, especially in view of the picture Achilles
offers, as he drags the slain Hector about the walls
of Troy to the lamentations of the dead man’s
father and mother.</p>

<p>Wherever there was a Greek colony we have a
story of the exposure of some god or hero. Greek
mythology might also be said to have had, as one
of its foundations, the right of the parent to reject
its offspring. The Dorians of Crete pictured even
mighty Jove as a victim of this practice, and as
being suckled by a goat. He was taken as soon
as he was born, to Lystus first, the most ancient
city of Crete, and then:</p>

<p>“Hid in a deep cave, ’neath the recesses of
the divine earth in the dense and wooded Ægean
mount.”<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<p>Among the Mantineians it was said that when
Rhea brought forth Poseidon she delivered him
“in a sheep cote to be brought up among the
lambs.”<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Lemnians, Hephaistos was supposed
to have been exposed,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> as was the Dionysus of the
Etolians and the Thracians.</p>

<p>In Epidaurus it is said that Coronis, when
she gave birth to Æsculapius, “exposed the infant
on that mountain which at present they call Titthion,
but which was before denominated Myrtion;
the name of the mountain being changed, because
the infant was suckled by one of those goats which
fed upon the mountain.”<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<p>In Argos, when Crotopos reigned, a grandson
was born to him, but the infant’s mother, fearing
the wrath of her father, “exposed the child to
perish. In consequence of this, it happened that
the infant was torn to pieces by the dogs that
guarded the royal cattle.”<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<p>In Arcadia, Auge, when she was delivered of
Telephus, “concealed him in the mountain
Parthenion, and he was there suckled by a hind.”<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></p>

<p>In his disappointment at not having a son born
to him, Jasus had the Arcadian Atalanta exposed
on the Parthenian hill<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a>; the ancestor of all the
Athenians, Ion, and the founders of Thebes,
Amphion, and Zethus, were exposed on the same
Mount Citharion where Œdipus was exposed.
Amphion afterward married Niobe and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
twelve children, six boys and six girls, were killed
by Apollo.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></p>

<p>Perhaps we can best judge the attitude of the
Homeric Greeks toward children by the later point
of view of the flower of Greek intellect. There is
not a line in Plato to indicate that the practices we
regard as so reprehensible were at all abhorrent to
him. In fact, there are passages that would
indicate that he not only regarded infanticide as
inevitable, but as unobjectionable; and in any
case, the incidental references to the practices of
his day show that the matter was one that had
given him no concern and had not disturbed his
philosophic calm. Thus, Plato has Socrates say
in the <i>Theætetus</i><a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a>:</p>

<p>“Then this child, however he may turn out,
which you and I have with difficulty brought into
the world. And now that he is born, we must run
round the hearth with him, and see whether he is
worth rearing, or is only a wind-egg and a sham.
Is he to be reared in any case, and not exposed? or
will you bear to see him rejected, and not get into a
passion if I take away your first-born?”</p>

<p>And in another place, Socrates emphasizes not
the sacredness of the life of the child, but the material
advantages that accrued to its progenitors<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a>:</p>

<p>“Must we not then, first of all, ask whether there
is any one of us who has knowledge of that about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
which we are deliberating? If there is, let us take
his advice, though he be one only, and not mind the
rest; if there is not, let us seek further counsel.
Is this a slight matter about which you and Lysimachus
are deliberating? Are you not risking
the greatest of your possessions? For children are
your riches; and upon their turning out well or ill
depends the whole order of their father’s house.”</p>

<p>Is it true that, aside from the laws of Gortyna,
which were excavated in 1884 on the island of
Crete,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> and the injunctions of Lycurgus, as given
to us by Plutarch, we have no positive declaration
as to the attitude of the legislator in reference to
children; but what is lacking in positive legislation
is made up by the plethora of literary allusions,
going to show a condition singularly heartless. It
is interesting to note that the laws of Gortyna,
which represent a period of civilization about 500
years before Christ, are not as humane as the
law ascribed to Romulus by Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
though the Greek laws are those of a people
supposedly more civilized than the tribes then
beginning their history on the Capitoline Hill.
There was a prohibition in the first law ascribed to
Romulus: and the extent of the law, as far as we
may presume to judge it, was to urge caution on
the people who were about to destroy their offspring.
Under the Roman law, all children were
to be kept for a short time at least, this limiting
the power of the father to kill, whereas the law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Gortyna emphasized the power of the father in the
matter of the life and death of the child; in one
specific instance, it gives the mother direct permission
to do away with the infant.</p>

<p>“If a woman bear a child,” so ran the Cretan
laws, “while living apart from her husband (after
divorce), she shall carry it to the husband at his
house, in the presence of three witnesses; and if he
do not receive the child, it shall be in the power of
the mother either to bring up or expose it. If a
female serf bear a child while living apart, she
shall carry it to the master of the man who married
her, in the presence of two witnesses. And if he do
not receive it, the child shall be in the power of the
master of the female serf. But, if she should
marry the same man again before the end of the
year, the child shall be in the power of the master
of the male serf, and the one who carried it and
the witnesses shall have preference in taking the
oath. If a woman living apart should put away
her child before she has presented it as written,
she shall pay, for a free child, fifty staters, for a
slave, twenty-five, if she be convicted.</p>

<p>“But if the man have no house, to which she may
carry it, or she do not see him, if she put away her
child, there shall be no penalty. If a female serf
should conceive and bear without being married,
the child shall be in the power of the master of the
father.”<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>In prehistoric times, the chief of the <i>yevos</i>
exercised his right of domain over his own house,
by deciding whether children should be brought
up or exposed. The reason back of this practice
was undoubtedly economic: “the fact of yesterday
is the doctrine of today,” says Junius.</p>

<p>The Hellenes in their attitude toward children
were as all the Aryan people, and, with few exceptions,
as most primitive people where moral ideas
had little developed; the right of the male parent
to kill his child if he so willed is, with variations, a
relic of the Stone Age.</p>

<p>Among the Greeks, the practice was well established,
for, wherever we find a Greek colony, the
traditions of the people show that either a notable
human or some mythical god began his history with
the story of exposure.</p>

<p>At Athens infanticide was especially common.
Aristophanes refers to it in a way that shows it was
an accepted practice. The first poet of humanity,
Euripides, dwells at great length, in the story of
Ion, on the exposure of an infant toward the end of
the fifth century; and in “The Phœnician Maidens,”
he has Jocasta tell the story of the exposure
of Œdipus<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a>:</p>

<p>In the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, the favourite figure
in the comedy of the day was the child that had
been exposed and saved, and afterwards found by
its parents. Terence and Plautus afterward used
this theme frequently, and undoubtedly their
comedies were all borrowed from the Greek.
Strange as it may seem in the cultured and refined
city of Athens with its great philosophers and
its wonderful art, the object of jest was a starving
and dying infant. Glotz, in discussing the motives
of this frequent exposure of infants in Athens, ascribed
to the shame of young women an initiatory
prominence. Viewing the subject more broadly,
however, we know that shame really plays a minor
part.</p>

<p>More frequently than not, the exposure of the
infant was ordered by the male parent. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
live question, current and customary, that the
father was obliged to face every time a child was
born: would he raise it or would he expose it? As
with all primitive peoples, the child was his absolute
property.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> On the fifth day, the Amphidromia
took place. If one interprets literally the passage
in the <i>Theætetus</i> of Plato, one must conclude that
this ceremony for receiving an infant into the
house was rigorously followed out in all cases, and
that before the altar of Hestia, the goddess of the
hearth, the father finally decided and proclaimed
whether he intended to keep the child and protect
it, or to abandon it. On the other hand, a father
who did not wish to recognize his child probably
needed no preliminary ceremony for such a decision;
if it was decided to abandon it, there was
probably no Amphidromia.</p>

<p>Doubt as to the paternity of the child, to judge
by the history and literature of the times, was of
frequent occurrence and this usually led to exposure.
Agis, King of Sparta, refused to recognize Leotychides,
a son born of his wife.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> In the <i>Hecyra</i>
of Terence, the Athenian Pamphile does not wish
to serve as father to an infant of another. Perseria,
“having viewed at an amorous crisis a statue
of Andromeda,” conceals her infant from her husband.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a>
At Gortyna, the divorced woman had
to present her son to her former husband; if that
man did not take it, then the woman had her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
choice between nourishing it or exposing it. In
most cases, the disavowal of paternity meant the
exposure of the infant.</p>

<p>But the mere fact that the legitimacy of the
child was incontestable did not save it; many
Greeks were discouraged by the thought of the
care and trouble children necessitated. Thousands
of these little ones seem to have been resented
by the Athenians, with what Glotz calls
“<i>singulière vivacité</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> With the intensive and
complete education necessary for those reared,
some children had to be sacrificed to so complicated
and burdensome an enterprise.</p>

<p>“No,” says a character in Menander, “there is
nothing unfortunate in being a father, unless one
is the father of many children.”</p>

<p>“Nothing more foolish than to have children,”
says a Greek proverb. “To raise children is an
uncertain thing,” said the philosopher Democritus;
“success is attained only after a life of battle and
disquietude. Their loss is followed by a sorrow
which remains above all others.”</p>

<p>It was not necessary to have children, reasoned
the nimble-minded Athenians; many who wished
both tranquillity and posterity adopted a young
man whose education was already complete. The
greater number of exposures should not be attributed,
however, to this excessive love of tranquillity.
The principal objection to children was their
expense. For the daughter, it was necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
prepare a <i>dot</i>: for boys, there was the expense of
an education prolonged until they were sixteen or
eighteen years of age. The latter imposed the
opening of an account not easy to close.</p>

<p>“I thought my family now large enough,” says
the father of Daphnis in explaining to the new-found
son why it was he was exposed.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></p>

<p>“Sons of the very rich,” said Plato, “who commence
to frequent schools at a very early age and
leave them late”—the rich themselves did not wish
to bring up too many sons to such an expensive
life. The rich father of Daphnis considered a son
and a daughter a large family.</p>

<p>At a pinch, the Athenians would undertake to
bring up a first child, but, as a rule, the second was
condemned. It was not for themselves, alone,
that this was done, they claimed: it was also for
their children that the heads of the Greek families
dreaded poverty. The direct transmission and
equal partition of property among the male children
was part of the Greek law, and a fair-sized
estate, if broken into many parts, made small
provision for many children. Hesiod wished for a
single son <i>par famille</i>: “Let there be only one son to
tend his father’s house: for so shall wealth increase
in the dwelling.”<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> And Theognis reproached the
citizens for having no other ideal than to bury
away treasures for their children. Even in later
times, Xenophon speaks of the paternal foresight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
that led to continual worrying over the care of
children yet to be born.</p>

<p>It was Diphilus, or Menander, who found in the
reality of the Greek life and communicated it to
the author of the <i>Adelphi</i>, this counsel addressed
to the father: “Manage, pinch, and save, to leave
them (your sons) as much as you can.”<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></p>

<p>But it was not only the poor who found exposure
expedient, although they had an excuse; they
“had not the heart to leave their misery to their
progeny like a grave and dolorous malady.”</p>

<p>To a philosopher of the first century after Christ,
it appeared as the greatest scandal, however, that
a number of fathers “who did not have the excuse
of poverty, who were well off and even opulent,
should dare to refuse food to the puny infants
in order to enrich their elders, should dare to kill
their brothers in order that the living might have
the greater patrimony.”<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></p>

<p>This was indeed the Greek excuse or explanation—some
of the children had to be sacrificed
that others might be raised. The head of a Greek
family, if asked why he had exposed some of his
children, would have probably answered in the
words of the Scythian Anacharsis, “Because I love
the children I have.” This was the principal
reason alleged by the Greeks for exposing their
progeny on the highways, and the father of Daph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>nis,
when he reclaims him, admits this to the son
he had exposed.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></p>

<p>In the religious and social ideas of the ancients,
the female child was of little importance—a son
alone perpetuating the race. The daughter was
hardly a member of the family in which she was
born, from the day of her birth until the day she
was married. On that day, she passed into the
possession of her husband and became his, body
and soul. Up to the time she was married, she was
in charge of her parents: after that time, she did
not even exist for them.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it was a sacred duty to bring
up a boy. To raise one, was to provide against
all possible trouble; whereas a girl was an expensive
luxury, a sacrifice for which there was no compensation,
and for this reason, in the legend, the
father of Atalanta refused to bring up his daughter.</p>

<p>“Do you remember,” asks Sostrata of her
husband in the <i>Heautontimorumenos</i>, “me being
pregnant, and yourself declaring to me, most peremptorily,
that if I should bring forth a girl, you
would not have it brought up?”<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> Thus it was that
Antiphili, although of good family, was exposed
by order of her mother.</p>

<p>One has but to read the fragments of the new
comedy to see how the Greeks plainly preferred
boys, and under what various artifices they disclosed
their dislike to girl children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p>Half of the <i>Florilegium</i> of Stobius is composed
of extracts under the title—“How much better
are male children.” In the first rank, he cites
Euripides, and after him the authors of the new
comedy, Menander at the head. Posidippus indicated
crudely the rule of conduct adopted by most
Athenians: “The son is brought up even if one is
poor: the daughter is exposed, even if one is rich.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>FEMALE CHILDREN NOT DESIRABLE AMONG GREEKS—PRECAUTIONS
FOR SAVING EXPOSED CHILDREN—ORNAMENTS
AS A MEANS OF IDENTIFICATION—ADOPTION
UNDER STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Greeks who exposed their children hoped,
as a rule, they might possibly be saved by
others and precautions were frequently
taken to this end. The gruesome task of doing
away with the infant was generally entrusted to a
slave or to a midwife, who were willing, apparently,
to undertake many services.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> The time usually
chosen was early in the day, inasmuch as the child
would perish if it passed the entire night without
attracting attention.</p>

<p>The lexicographers and the scholiasts of the
time speak of children being left in deserted places.
In the “golden days,” they were placed where
they could be seen. There is evidence that the
most frequented places were the most popular—the
hippodromes, the entrances to the temples,
and the sacred grottoes, where they would be most
in evidence. A watch was kept on the place or it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
was revisited, in order to be sure of the fate of the
infant.</p>

<p>Care was usually taken to wrap the child up
carefully. When Laymonde, the shepherd, discovered
Daphnis, the child was being suckled by a goat.
“Struck with natural astonishment, he advances
closer to the spot and discovers a lusty and handsome
male child with far richer swathing clothes
than suited its fortune in being thus exposed; for
its little mantle was of fine purple, and fastened
by a golden clasp; and it had a little sword with a
hilt of ivory.”<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<p>The jests of Aristophanes show that more
often children were exposed in large copper pots
with two handles, called <i>kutrai</i> (κυτρἀι). The
Athenians had been in the habit of making
sacrifices to some of their divinities in these <i>kutrai</i>,
and it is likely that when children were first
abandoned, they were placed in these receptacles
that they might invoke the protection of the
immortals. Recent excavations at Gezer and Tell
Ta’Andkk show children were sacrificed in a similar
way.</p>

<div class="caption">BLIND BOYS AT DRILL IN “THE LIGHTHOUSE,” NEW YORK CITY</div>
</div>

<p>Various objects were placed with the child when
it was so exposed. Creusa, the daughter of Erectheus,
King of Athens, when she exposed Ion,
the son whom she had secretly borne to Apollo,
“observant of the customs of her great progenitors,”
in addition to leaving with him what ornaments
she had, also added:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">A branch of olive then I wreathed around thee,</div>
<div class="line">Plucked from that tree which from Minerva’s rock</div>
<div class="line">First sprung; if it be there it still retains</div>
<div class="line">Its verdure; for the foliage of that olive,</div>
<div class="line">Fresh in immortal beauty, never fades.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This, and the sacred bandelettes, were always
the symbols of inviolability.</p>

<p>This final act of maternal affection, characteristic
of both the human and the barbaric side of
Greek parents, became, in time, a widespread
custom. When the child was exposed, there was
generally placed alongside of it a small basket or
collection of trinkets. The royal daughter of
Erechtheus attached to the neck of her son many
precious ornaments, including a serpent of massive
gold. The shepherd Laymonde found on Daphnis
a clasp of gold and a small ivory sword. Among
the very poor, hand-made collars, shoulder straps,
with various trinkets of little worth, were used
to mark the infant.</p>

<p>In all this, dramatists saw but a means to establish
the identity of the hero and heroine and an
assistance to the <i>dénouement</i>. The ceremony, with
its pathos and its strangeness, was, to tragic as
well as to comic writers, but a means to end the
fifth act. The pity of it all never seems to have
occurred to the Greek mind.</p>

<p>It was rare that the father or the child-mother
who renounced the infant had any real desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
find it when better days came. The real wish was
that the child might be taken up by some stranger
before death came and the trinkets were an inducement
to befriend the child.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the child should die, the
feeling was that these ornaments would assure for
it a happy life on the other side of the Styx.</p>

<p>For this reason the favoured objects of mothers
were amulets; and, as in the case of the serpent
placed around the neck of Ion, Creusa hoped to
invoke the aid of Minerva, who had guarded her
ancestor, Erichthonius, with two dragons; the
object being to watch over the child’s existence.
These gewgaws were supposed to give the infant
exposed all the rights of a suppliant.</p>

<p>As to how far these ceremonies of supplication
were successful, as to how far they commended
the unfortunate infant to the public, is a grave
question. From the religious and literary myths
one might imagine that the greater number of the
infants were saved. We read of Hephaistus,
nourished by the Sintians or by Thetis; of Atalanta
by a bear; of Zeus and Dionysos, nursed by
the nymphs; the shepherds found and received
Telephus, Amphion, and Œdipus; Ion, by a
priestess, and Sirus, by a beggar.</p>

<p>Greek artists frequently show a Satyr holding in
his arms a newly-born that he had found on the
road.</p>

<p>Poets of the new comedy delight to represent
their heroes, or, more frequently, their heroines, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
people who had gone through the trial of exposure
and were raised by either courtesans, shepherds, or
innkeepers. It is in this way that Menander,
among others, shows us Silenium growing up in the
house of Melænis to whom she has been given by
the evil woman who picked her up<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a>; Casina treated
as a daughter by the brave Cleostrata.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></p>

<p>Longus, in this way, brings Daphnis and Chloë
into the cabin of a goatherd.</p>

<p>But these examples prove little about the actual
conditions, only going to show the facility of the
writers of the time, and Glotz suggests that these
scenes flattered the Athenians, who liked to think
of themselves as a philanthropic people.</p>

<p>Apparently, the first impulse when a child was
found was to ignore it, for the attitude of Athenian
society was probably well expressed by Longus
when he said:</p>

<p>“Those who seek paternity are many.”</p>

<p>In fact, the author of <i>Daphnis and Chloë</i> says
that when Daphnis was first seen by the shepherd
being suckled by a goat, “Laymonde (the shepherd)
resolved to leave it to its fate, and to carry off only
the tokens; but feeling afterward ashamed at the
reflection, that in doing so he should be inferior in
humanity, even to a goat, he waited for the approach
of night and then carried home the infant
with the tokens.”<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></p>

<p>Old Megacles, the father of Chloë, in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
story seeks to excuse himself for having exposed
his daughter, by a number of bad reasons: he did
not have the means, it was a moment of weakness,
he hoped that the nymphs would take pity on the
child: and then, there were so many people who
did not have children, etc. The most interesting
of his reasons, however, is the statement that
he had spent his fortune equipping theatrical
choruses!</p>

<p>As a rule, when adoption did take place it was
not for the benefit of the child. In many instances,
those who wished to adopt a son waited and adopted
a grown-up one so as not to have the trouble and
expense of educating him.</p>

<p>As set forth in the plays, it was apparently not
infrequent that a courtesan sought to attach a
lover, or a wife a husband who was slipping away
from her, by adopting a child and passing it off
as her own. It was to this subterfuge that Silenium,
in the <i>Cistellaria</i> of Plautus, owes her life.
Speaking of the incident, the Procuress in the
play, says:</p>

<p>“But once upon a time, that girl (Silenium) who
has gone hence in tears, from a lane I carried her
off a little child exposed.... I made a present of her
to my friend, this courtesan, who had made mention
of it to me that somewhere I must find for her
a boy or a girl, just born, that she herself might
pass it off as her own.</p>

<p>“As soon as ever the opportunity befell me I
immediately granted her request in that which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
had asked me. After she had received this female
child from me, she at once was brought to bed of
the same female child which she had received from
me.... She said that her lover was a foreigner.”<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></p>

<p>It is hardly likely, however, that many courtesans
in real life were willing to be so encumbered, and
perhaps, as Demosthenes says, this was only the
sort of thing one “sees in tragedies,” like the fatal
and convenient malady described by Heine as a
sort of “fifth act sickness.”</p>

<p>That the substitution of foundlings and exposed
children was frequent in Greece is evident, however,
from the many plays bearing this name.
Cratinus the younger was the author of a piece
called <i>The Substituted Child</i> [ὑποβολιμάιος], and
the title was also used by Menander. Athenæus
quotes from a play by Alexis entitled <i>The Suppositious
Child</i><a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> and from one by Epinicus called
the <i>Suppositious Damsels</i> [ὑποβολλομενᾶι] and from<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a>
another by Crobylus called the <i>Pseudo-Suppositious
Child</i> (<i>Falsus suppositus</i>).<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></p>

<p>In the Thesmophoriazusæ, Aristophanes depicts
the father of Euripides, Mnesilochus, as making a
tactless defence of his son-in-law at the festival of
Thesmophoria by abusing the very women he
would placate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>“And I know another woman,” he says “who
for ten days said she was in labour, till she purchased
a little child while her husband went about
purchasing drugs for a quick delivery. But the
child an old woman brought in a pot with its
mouth stopped with honeycomb that it might
not squall. Then, when she that carried it nodded,
the wife immediately cried out: ‘Go away, husband,
go away, for methinks that I shall be
immediately delivered.’ For the child kicked
against the bottom of the pot. And he ran off
delighted, while she drew out the stoppage from
the bottle and it cried out. And then the abominable
old woman who brought the child, runs smiling
to the husband, and says: ‘A lion has been born
to you, a lion; your very image, in all other respects
whatever, and its nose is like yours, being
crooked like an acorn cup.’”<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<p>That there was a class of people who looked on
children in the light of good or bad bargains we
must assume from the certainly serious words of
Demosthenes in his oration against Midias. In
his attack on his physical assailant, Demosthenes
says that the real mother of Midias was a wise
woman because she got rid of him as soon as he
was born, whereas the woman who adopted him
was a foolish woman because she made a bad
bargain.</p>

<p>“And why?” asks the orator, “because the one
sold him as soon as he was born, while the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
when she might have obtained a better for the
same price, bought Midias.”</p>

<p>Ion,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> when he meets his father for the first time
and learns that he had been exposed, congratulates
himself on having escaped slavery, indicating
that in all probability the majority of children
saved after they had been exposed by their parents
were saved by the professional slave dealers. The
general view, however, was that children were
cheap, Xenophon,<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> declaring that “good slaves
when they had children generally become still
better disposed, but bad ones increase their power
to do mischief.”</p>

<p>Only in two instances as far as we know did the
law of the Greeks reach out to protect the child
against the destroying whim of the parent. According
to Ælian<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> the Thebans were not allowed
to expose their children or leave them in a wilderness
under the pain of death. If the father were
extremely poor, the child, whether male or female,
had to be brought to the magistrate in its swaddling
clothes, and there delivered to some person who
would agree to bring up the child and when it was
grown up, take it into service and have the benefit
of its labour in return for its education.</p>

<p>As to the other instance of the law protecting
the child it has been truly said that all that Lycur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>gus
did was to insist that all “fit” children should
be raised.</p>

<p>“If,” says Plutarch,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> “they (the Spartans)
found it puny and ill-shaped, they ordered it to be
taken to what was called the Apothetæ, a sort of
chasm under Taygetus, as thinking it neither for
the good of the child itself, nor for the public
interest, that it should be brought up, if it did not
from the very outset, appear made to be healthy
and vigorous.”</p>

<p>And this was the most “protecting” move of the
ancient Greeks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>FIRST RECOGNITION OF RIGHTS OF CHILDREN—LAWS OF
ROMULUS AND OF NUMA POMPILIUS—THE TWELVE
TABLES—ATTITUDE OF PARENTS SHOWN IN TERENCE—PATRIA
POTESTAS SPARINGLY USED.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T is interesting to think that what might be
called the legal movement which fructified
in the United States, in the latter half of the
nineteenth century, had its beginning in the
eighth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> in Rome; it is doubly interesting
that legend ascribes to Romulus the first
interest in what can conservatively be called the
child protection movement.</p>

<p>Like all other lawmakers—even legendary ones—especially
those who sought to prepare and
safeguard their states for and against hostile
neighbours, the first concern of the founder of
Rome was a strong nation; and a strong nation
meant necessarily as many adult males in good
health and physical condition as possible. Soldiers
were more important than other human
beings; in this the supposed founder followed the
spirit of his time and the standard of his age of
development.</p>

<p>According to the legend, Romulus, having made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
peace with the Sabines and become the king of
both people on the death of Tatius, was bent on
making the new city impregnable, working out a
system of government that, in the mind of the
historian, was worthy of “a man of great military
accomplishments, personal courage and extremely
capable of instituting the most perfect sort of
government.”<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></p>

<p>To the end that there might be as perfect a
fighting machine as possible, Romulus pledged his
people to bring up all males except those who were
lame or monstrous from birth. To the same end,
and according to the same authority, he pledged
them to bring up the first-born of the females—and
in this he acted purely in the spirit of the time
and as the founder of a warlike race. Personal
interest may be conceded, inasmuch as he would
have been the victim of the practice of exposing
children had his uncle Amulius had his way.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></p>

<p>In his introduction to the <i>Institutes of Justinian</i>,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a>
Sandars declares that Roman law will be better
understood if those interested will apprehend the
distinction between the contribution of Romulus
and the tribe of Ramnes, who dwelt on the Palatine
Hill, and the contribution of Numa and the
Titienses who dwelt on the Capitoline and the
Quirinal. The two races combined to make a
united society, the Ramnes bringing distinct ideas
of public law and, in the dimmest days of history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
presenting the features of a carefully organized
polity. “When the tribe went out to war it did
not conquer lands for the benefit of individuals,
but for the whole people.”<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

<p>The Titienses, or Quirites, on the other hand,
were of Sabine extraction. To them are traceable
the private law, and, what is of interest to us, the
peculiar notions of the family and of property.
The great peculiarity of the Sabine law, or as it was
called by the Latin writers, the <i>jus</i> Quirium, was
the form of the <i>manus</i>—the hand. The <i>manus</i>
was the conqueror’s sign of conquest, or rather the
insignia of the freebooter; all he laid hand upon
became absolutely his; he could deal with it as he
pleased. All that his wife and children had, also
belonged to him, to be done with as he willed—even
their lives. This was the Sabine contribution
to what afterward became “Roman Law,” when
the Sabine tribes of the Capitoline Hill and the
Ramnes tribe of the Palatine united to form the
city of Rome.</p>

<p>Nowhere in law or history is there so interesting
a duality as this origin of Rome and the Roman
law, and no single custom arising as it did, has
affected civilization as strangely and so widely.
To think of a tribe living at Fleet Street super-imposing
a law on a tribe living at Westminster,
or a clan having its habitat in Wall Street grafting
a law upon a people fortressed and buttressed in
Madison Square Garden—taking either section of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
London or New York as an example of the extent
of the Rome of that day—it seems impossible that
such a law, thus accepted, should become the law
of the world, and remain so for centuries.</p>

<p>This power of the Roman father over the very
lives of his children was called the <i>patria potestas</i>
and nowhere else in a civilized community was
there anything like it.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> He had the power to sell
his children, he had the power to mutilate them,
he had the power to kill them; and it is because
there is evident first, in the laws ascribed to
Romulus, an intention to abate that power, not
only for military purposes but for what we would
now call humane reasons, that I have referred to
the first Roman lawmaker as an innovator along
lines which have been historically neglected.</p>

<p>It matters little whether or not the Romulus of
Plutarch and Dionysius existed; it does matter
that the human note was in the laws of his time,
and that citizens of the new city were enjoined
not only to bring up all healthy male children—and
at least one female child—but that all children
must be allowed to live <i>until they were three
years old</i>, unless they were lame or monstrous.</p>

<p>Surely here was the beginning of some recognition
of the rights of children. Even the lame and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
the monstrous in the eyes of this early lawgiver
had some rights, for it was further decreed that
parents in doing away with them must act not
entirely on their own judgment.</p>

<p>“These (the lame and monstrous infants) he
allowed their parents to expose, provided they first
showed them to five of their neighbours and these
also approved of it, and besides other penalties he
punished those who disobeyed this law with the
confiscation of half their fortunes.”<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p>

<p>It may be contended perhaps that we are giving
high attributes to one who is not much more than a
mythical person, but no other explanation of the
law of Romulus is offered than that already referred
to in Dionysius.</p>

<p>Despite the credit given to Numa Pompilius,
by both Plutarch and Gibbon, Romulus gains by
the comparison, although Numa amended one of
the laws of Romulus in the matter of the right of a
father to control a son up to the point of being
able to sell him as a slave.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<p>“If a father gives his son leave to marry a woman
who, by law, is to partake of his sacrifices and
fortunes, he shall no longer have power of selling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
his son”—such was the amendment of Numa for
which Plutarch commends the Sabine lawmaker;
but in amending the law of Romulus permitting
a father to sell his children, the second king of
Rome was actuated by the idea of making it
attractive for the young women to marry; doubtless
he was having no easy time in eradicating the
differences between the two warlike tribes first
brought together under his predecessor. Lessening
the power of the parents, as he did in the most
material degree,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> it was for the purpose of general
polity and the accomplishment of his own harmonious
designs, rather than for what I like to call,
even in that early day, humanitarian reasons.
There was no consideration of the child, or the
female as such in Numa’s amendment. His
object was to make marriages more desirable that
there might be more <i>male</i> Romans.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, declaration of the power of
the father over the women and children of his
family was nothing more on the part of Romulus
than the codification of the laws of the past, with
the softening provisos to which I have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
referred. The power of the father to imprison,
scourge, or sell his son for a slave, or put him to
death, was not lessened even when that son had
risen to the highest honours of the State, as we
shall see later.</p>

<p>Expulsion of the kings and the establishment of
the Republic is dated <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> 509, some two hundred
and fifty years after the reputed founding of the
city. With this stern period begins a series of
thrilling examples of the use made of the <i>patria
potestas</i>—stories that in themselves show how the
power of the father extended over the life of the
child, even when the child had become a man, and
that man had been honoured by the State as was
Cassius Viscellinus. The latter, although a tribune
of the people and the author of the first Agrarian
Law, was tried in the house of his own father, who,
after having him whipped, “commanded him to be
put to death and his estate consecrated to Ceres.”<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<p>That there was little progress made in the next
great step in the history of Roman law, by which
of course one refers to the adoption of the laws of
the Twelve Tables, was because those laws were
practically the codification of the ancient customary
law of the people, despite the story that
the patricians dispatched three commissioners to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Athens to bring home a copy of the laws of Solon.
Acrid political fights, uncertain and sometimes
corrupt administration of the law, led to the
commission empowered to draw up what afterward
became the Twelve Tables and the foundation
of the whole fabric of the Roman law.</p>

<p>As the laws of the Twelve Tables represented
the earliest fight against privilege, it would be
too much to expect that they should contain any
amelioration of the statute which gave the father
the right to sell or kill his children. Even the
language of the laws, in the fragments which have
come down to us, shows in rugged, concise, and
sternly imperative style that the law gained the
respect in which it eventually came to be held, by
no soft or easy methods.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></p>

<p>“If the complainant summon the defendant
before the magistrate, he shall go; if he do not go,
the plaintiff may call a bystander to witness, and
take him by force;” this is the first section of the
first paragraph of the laws of the Twelve Tables.</p>

<p>Where there was so much sternness, and where
every family was presided over by a parent who
had the right to inflict death as a punishment for
disobedience, the disciplinary attitude of the
Roman mind naturally became such, no matter
what it had been in the beginning, that tender or
human emotions had but little place. It is not
surprising therefore that the one extract of the
laws of the Twelve Tables, relating to our subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
should deal curiously, abruptly, and sharply with
the power of the father to sell his son, a power that
was diminished only after the son’s spirit must
have been entirely extinguished.</p>

<p><i>Si pater filium ter venum duit, filius a patre liber
esto</i>—if a father sells his son three times, let the
son then go free of the father. In other words,
three times did the father have the right to dispose
of his son as a slave; and, while a slave might
purchase his freedom, by paying his master, the
son of a Roman citizen did not become free until
the father had abused his right and misused the
<i>potestas</i> three times.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></p>

<p>One sees the Rome of the Republic in the plays
of Terence and Plautus, and the attitude of the
parents toward exposure is vividly shown in the
<i>Heautontimorumenos</i> of the former.</p>

<p>Nearly always the exposed child died. Occasionally
some escaped through the tenderness or
cupidity of some passer-by who would pick up an
exposed child either out of pity or for the material
profit that came with the possession.</p>

<p>Sometimes mothers who were obliged to obey
the orders of their husbands, arranged to have their
children rescued. The comedy of Terence goes to
show what the attitude of the father was under
such circumstances. It is indeed, as De Gour says,
“a chapter of the morals of the Greeks and
Romans seen in action.”</p>

<p>Chremes, departing on a long voyage, orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
his wife, Sostrata, who is about to have a child, to
expose the child if it should turn out to be a girl.
In obeying this order, she hopefully places a ring
with the child.</p>

<p>Years later she meets the child at a bath and is
given (by her own daughter) a ring to guard.
Sostrata recognizes the ring and when she sees
her husband the following dialogue ensues:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> (<i>turning ’round</i>). Ha! my husband!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> Ha! my wife!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> I was looking for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> Tell me what you want.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> In the first place, this I beg of you, not to
believe that I have ventured to do anything contrary
to your commands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> Would you have me believe you in
this, although so incredible? Well, I will believe
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> Do you remember my being pregnant, and
yourself declaring to me, most peremptorily, that
if I should bring forth a girl, you would not have it
brought up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> I know what you have done, you have
brought it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> Not at all; but there was here an elderly
woman of Corinth, of no indifferent character; to
her I gave it to be exposed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> O Jupiter! that there should be such
extreme folly in a person’s mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> Alas! what have I done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> And do you ask the question?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> If I have acted wrong, my dear Chremes,
I have done so in ignorance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> This, indeed, I know for certain, even
if you were to deny it, that in everything you both
speak and act ignorantly and foolishly: how many
blunders you disclose in this single affair! For, in
the first place, then, if you had been disposed to
obey my orders, the child ought to have been dispatched;
you ought not in words to have feigned
her death, and in reality to have left hopes of her
surviving. But that I pass over; compassion,
maternal affection, I allow it. But how finely
you did provide for the future! What was your
meaning? Do reflect. It’s clear, beyond a doubt,
that your daughter was betrayed by you to this
old woman, either that through you she might
make a living by her, or that she might be sold in
open market as a slave. I suppose you reasoned
thus: “Anything is enough, if only her life is
saved.” What are you to do with those who
understand neither law, nor right and justice? Be
it for better or for worse, be it for them or against
them, they see nothing except just what they
please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> My dear Chremes, I have done wrong, I
own; I am convinced. Now this I beg of you; inasmuch
as you are more advanced in years than I,
be so much the more ready to forgive; so that your
justice may be some protection for my weakness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> I’ll readily forgive you doing this, of
course; but Sostrata, my easy temper prompts you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
to do amiss. But, whatever this circumstance is,
by reason of which this was begun upon, proceed
to tell it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> As we women are all foolishly and wretchedly
superstitious, when I delivered the child to
her to be exposed, I drew a ring from off my finger
and ordered her to expose it, together with the
child; that if she should die, she might not be without
some portion of our possessions.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> That was right; thereby you proved
the saving of yourself and her.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> (<i>holding out the ring</i>). This is the ring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> Whence did you get it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> From the young woman whom Bacchis
brought with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> What does she say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> She gave it to me to keep for her, whilst
she went to bathe. At first I paid no attention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
it; but after I looked at it, I at once recognized
it, and came running to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> What do you suspect now, or have
you discovered, relative to her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> I don’t know; unless you enquire of
herself whence she got it, if that can possibly be
discovered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> Is this woman living to whom you
delivered the child?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> What account did she bring you at
the time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> That she had done as I had ordered her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> Tell me what is the woman’s name,
that she may be inquired after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> Philtere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> Sostrata follow me this way indoors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sos.</span> How much beyond my hopes has this
matter turned out! How dreadfully afraid I was,
Chremes, that you would now be of feelings as
unrelenting as formerly you were on exposing the
child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chrem.</span> Many a time a man cannot be such
as he would be<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> if circumstances do not admit of
it. Time has now so brought it about, that I
should be glad of a daughter; formerly I wished
for nothing less.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that the Romans as a
people at any time approved of the sale of children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
and while the suggestion is made by Gibbon that
early in the days of the kings impoverishing conditions
occasionally made it necessary to dispose of
members of the family, from the time of the
adoption of the Twelve Tables as the codified law
of Rome there is not a single indication that the
power of the father over grown-up children was
used otherwise than sparingly, and with a view
to strengthening the stern and military character
of the Roman idea of family. The main use of the
provision for the sale of children, in time of prosperity
at least, was to put the boy out to business,
this being in general more a form that took the
place of what was later apprenticeship and, still
later, the labour contract. As late as Constantine
this was permitted, even of new-born children, but
only in cases of extreme need (<i>propter nimiam
paupertatem</i>),<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> and then when it seemed the only
way to prevent their parents from murdering them.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>STONISHING depravity marked the last
days of the Republic, to the point where it
was even said that annual divorces were
as much the fashion in Rome as voluntary celibacy.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a>
Seneca says there were women who

considered censurable and even guilty,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> whereas
later it was not only condoned but wittily approved,

and immoral dramatists of the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>

<p>Civil wars and proscriptions had left great voids
in Roman families; more prolific foreigners, freed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>men,
and slaves began to dominate the noisy city
now beginning to earn her title of Mistress of the
World. The visitor to Pompeii today, noting the
large and heavy paving blocks, the narrow sidewalks,
the deep ruts made in these solid streets by
the heavy wagons, the open shops, the indecent
signs, sees Rome in miniature. All this cosmopolitan
disorder marked the greater town that had not
twenty thousand inhabitants but a million; the
noise and the congestion increased out of all
proportion to its size because of the character of
its dwellers, for Rome had a large foreign population.
As in modern New York or London, it was
in the foreign quarters that were found the discomforts,
the loud misunderstandings, and the
noisy, tragic fights for small things.</p>

<p>The stranger arriving in Rome had hardly entered
its gates when he was being jostled and
shoved. The narrow streets were filled with pedlars
calling their wares of all kinds, from matches (<i>sulphurata</i>),
in exchange for broken glass where money
was scarce, to a dish of boiled peas for an <i>as</i>, or fine
smoking sausages for those who had more money.
Idlers filled the streets at all hours, but especially
at the lunch hour (the sixth) when business ceased
and those who patronized the cafés (<i>tabernæ</i>) were
hurrying to get to their accustomed tables.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></p>

<p>Around billboards (<i>programmata</i>) announcing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>new plays or exhibitions, crowds gathered while
other groups watched acrobats, who beat themselves
for the comic effects produced; dancers,
jugglers, snake charmers, and performers of every
kind and nation abounded. Heavily loaded wagons
rumbled noisily along while their drivers cursed and
lashed the tired beasts of burden, or the appearance
of a tamed bear threw an entire street into wild
and joyous confusion. Or perhaps a new troupe of
gladiators entered town, to the complete cessation
of all business and pastimes.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> Here and there in
the streets, money-changers and others set up
tables in convenient places where they were least
apt to be driven away, and hawked loudly the
bargains that they offered. Money from all the
world was then flowing Romeward, and in nothing
was this shown more than in expensive funerals,
with their hired and vociferous mourners, blocking
the streets and putting an end for the time being,
to other business—and amusements.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> Narrow as
were the streets, they were made more so by the
<i>tabernæ</i>, built up against the houses, this practice
becoming so much of a nuisance (as in modern
times) that the Emperor Domitian caused a decree
to be issued against them, forcing the owners to
remove the encroachments and confine themselves
to the area of the house.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></p>

<p>A drunken man taking the entire <i>via</i> in his
navigation—to the amusement of the crowd; a
member of the city guard hurrying some offender
to the court; or, reclining in his <i>lectica</i>, a noble,
carried by six uniformed slaves, his other numerous
attendants clearing the way for him—all
these added to the noise and confusion—while
through it all children crowded the curb with their
games.</p>

<p>Such was the Rome that Augustus found, its
proud citizens masters of the world, luxurious,
sensual, disdainful of the very idea of duty, idling
days away while they scoffed at marriage. But
the foreigners, the freedmen, and the slaves married,
and when the burden of a new child was too much
for the small income made by amusing or serving
some Roman citizen, the little newcomer was
thrown into the Tiber or left unmarked on a busy
thoroughfare. One of the first undertakings of
Augustus was to try to remedy these evil conditions
by laws and fiscal measures, his principal
endeavour being to put an end to the corruption
of morals and the exhaustion of the legitimate
population.</p>

<p>From the day of the battle of Actium (<span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> 31)
when the Roman world practically lay at his feet,
Octavius, or Augustus as he was afterward called,
while gratifying his ambition in adding to his
power, studiously and ostentatiously observed the
forms of popular government. In this he was
paying heed to the fate of his uncle and also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
conciliating the people, though with every ingratiating
move he increased his power.</p>

<p>One of the first laws he proposed was the <i>lex
Julia</i> (<i>de maritandis ordinibus</i>) which was rejected
by the <i>comitia tributa</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> 18, but was adopted in
<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 4. To this was added as a supplement the
<i>lex Papia Poppæa</i>, the two being known as the
<i>lex Julia et Papia</i> or as <i>novæ leges</i>, or simply <i>leges</i>,
the latter reference indicating that they were
referred to as the laws <i>par excellence</i>. Not only
marriage, but everything connected with it was
treated in these two laws, which really constituted
a code, the most extensive after the laws of the
Twelve Tables.</p>

<p>These laws made a great impression on Roman
society. How completely customs had swung to
extremes since the days of Romulus is shown in
this <i>lex Papia</i>, as Gaius calls it. Instead of
securing the father in his right over the life of
children, as the stern head of the house who might
decide at will whether he should let his offspring
live, the law now decreed that it was through the
children that he gained a status in the community.
Persons who were not married and had no children
were unable to inherit; the unmarried person not
being able to take any part of what had been left
to him, and the married person without children
(<i>orbus</i>) being able to take only one half.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
the provisions of the <i>lex Julia</i>, or the <i>leges</i>, were
those entitling that candidate for office who had
the greatest number of children to preference.
Of the two consuls it was decreed that he should
be the senior whose children were the most numerous;
a relief from all personal taxes and burdens
was granted to citizens who had three children if
they lived in Rome, four if they lived in Italy, and
five if they lived in the provinces.</p>

<p>With the establishment of the <i>caduca</i>, by which
there was instituted a punishment for sterility
and a reward for legitimate procreation, it can be
seen that there would follow some diminution in
the number of children exposed, though according
to Tacitus,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> “marriages and the rearing of children
did not become more frequent, so powerful are the
attractions of the childless state.”</p>

<p>By giving the people, or the common treasury,
the benefit of the clause forfeiting the inheritance
on account of sterility, the law was recognizing
the <i>populus</i> as the common father, a legal concept
that is becoming more and more the attitude of
the twentieth century, and was then first trenchantly
expressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p>Suppressed in part by the constitution of Caracalla
as to the privileges of paternity to the claim
upon the <i>caduca</i>, and by Constantine as to the
penalties for celibacy, these laws were not completely
and textually abrogated until Justinian.
They were the beginning, however, of the new
movement; out of the degeneration and degradation
of the waning days of the Republic there had
come at least this forward step, though the patricians
complained that these provisions gave rise to
despised informers and opportunities for tyrannical
misuse of power.</p>

<p>The child now had some other than a future use;
it had an immediate value. Occasionally, in
times past, strangers had picked up children
exposed by their parents and had reared them as
slaves, or maimed and blinded them for the profession
of begging. Augustus set aside a reward
of two thousand sesterces (about $40.00) for the
person who would rear an orphan. This was the
seed of a growing humanity, the first intimation of
an inclination to treat children with kindness,
though it contrasts with Augustus’s own personal
conduct when his anger was aroused. Both his
daughter and granddaughter were so profligate
that he banished them; when his granddaughter
Julia was delivered of a child after sentence, he
ordered that the child be “neither owned as a
relative nor brought up.”<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></p>

<p>From the death of Augustus, 14 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
reign of Nerva, 96 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>, the violent sway of the
army and the tragic fate of successive emperors
cloud the history of Roman law and progress.</p>

<p>The Emperor Claudius distinguished himself by
ordering that Claudia, a child by his first wife,
“who was in truth the daughter of his freedman
Boter, be thrown naked at her mother’s door.”<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></p>

<p>There were no successors to the great jurists of
the type of Capito and Labeo, whose opinions in
Augustan days were accepted by even the emperor
himself. With the coming of Nerva there
was a great change in the attitude toward children.
Despite a short reign of two years and a reputation
for a weak will, it was to his initiative that the
State owed the movement to put an end to the
practice of abandoning infants, by having the government
subsidize poor parents.</p>

<p>Apparently there was no other way of stopping
this ruinous custom in a degenerate day. It was
useless to appeal to the rich to rear families, and
the poor who were still producing children were
becoming poorer. One of Nerva’s noteworthy acts
to alleviate conditions was the founding of colonies,
and it was in accordance with the same general
plan that, a few months before he died, he ordered
that assistance should be given parents who found
themselves without the means of bringing up their
offspring.</p>

<p>This order was issued in the year 97, and so
successful was the experiment under his successor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
who accepted and enlarged the plan, that in the
year 100, five thousand children were receiving aid
from the State. Much credit is given to Trajan
for following up the ideas of Nerva, but it was to
Nerva that Rome owed Trajan, one of the most
humane of her emperors.</p>

<p>Another evidence of the humanity of Nerva was
the fact that he prohibited the making of eunuchs,
a practice that had met with the disfavour of the
Emperor Domitian years before, and a practice
that led the Pope Clement XIV., to decree, centuries
later, that no more <i>castrats</i> should sing in
churches. And these things he did when the
extravagance of his predecessors had made it
necessary for him to sell the imperial furniture
and jewels in order to replenish the treasury.
One of his coins shows him seated in the <i>curule</i>
chair, dispensing charity to a boy and girl, the
mother standing near, with the legend “Tutela
Italia.”</p>

<p>One need only to read the gentle replies of the
Emperor Trajan to the younger Pliny, to see that,
in that reign at least, there was a great change and
that the conception of duty in the modern sense
was creeping into a military world. Pliny himself,
in a letter to Cannius, describes how he settled
five hundred thousand sesterces (about $20,000)
on the city of Como for the maintenance of children,
“who were born of good families”—an act as
traceable to the growing protective tendency as to
Pliny’s patriotism and love of glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>According to the tablet of Velia<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> to the Emperor
Trajan, the landed proprietors of the place received
on mortgage at five per cent.,<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> less than half the
usual rate of that time, what would be about $50,000
of our money, the interest of which was to go
to the maintenance of three hundred poor children.</p>

<p>The means employed to help parents and prevent
them from exposing their children were
skilfully contrived. Through the municipality,
Trajan lent money to certain proprietors to improve
their land, and the interest paid on this loan
constituted a benevolent fund by which the children
were taken care of, or rather, by which their
parents were rewarded for not murdering them.
From the table of Velia we learn also that fifty-one
proprietors of that section received on land
twelve times the value of the loan, or 1,116,000
sesterces ($52,820) the annual interest of which,
55,800 sesterces ($2,650), constituted a fund for
the support of three hundred children, two hundred
and sixty-four boys and thirty-six girls. The boys
received annually 192 sesterces, and the girls 144
sesterces. Illegitimate children were given less,
the boys 144 sesterces, and the girls 120 sesterces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
although in the tablet there were only two illegitimate
children, one boy and one girl. The fact that
the number of girls assisted was only one-tenth the
number of boys, goes to show, that this new institution
was not due so much to the fact that the
sentiment of charity had infiltrated through pagan
society, as to the fact that pagan society was
endeavouring to repair the ravages of degenerate
and pauperistic days, shown in the diminution of
the class of freedmen in Rome.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></p>

<p>Writing to Pliny at Bithynia, to which place he
had been sent by Trajan as imperial legate, the
Emperor mildly answers an inquiry as to what the
law shall be in that province regarding deserted
children. Trajan rules that deserted children, who
are found and brought up, shall be allowed their
freedom without being obliged to repay the money
expended for their maintenance.</p>

<p>“The question concerning such children who
were exposed by their parents,” says Trajan,
“and afterward preserved by others, and educated
in a state of servitude, though born free, has
been frequently discussed; but I do not find in the
constitutions of the princes, my predecessors, any
general regulation upon this head extending to all
the provinces. There are, indeed, some rescripts
of Domitian to Avidius Niguinus and Armenius
Brocchus, which ought to be observed; but Bithynia
is not comprehended in the provinces therein
mentioned. I am of opinion, therefore, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
claims of those who assert their right of freedom
upon this principle, should be allowed, without
compelling them to purchase their liberty by repaying
the money advanced for their maintenance.”<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></p>

<p>A new note this, for in order to encourage the
saving of children who had been exposed, the
custom had been rigidly followed that the person
who saved a child was able to regard it as his slave,
without regard to what its condition had been
previous to exposure.</p>

<p>As shown in the correspondence of Pliny and
Trajan, there is much truth, in the contention
that the Emperor shows up better than the philosopher
and poet.</p>

<p>The noteworthy thing about this remarkable
exchange of letters is that a new spirit is revealed.
It is a living, working philosophy that we discover,
practical results of that philosophy bringing a
kindlier treatment of slaves, a greater respect for
women, a more thoughtful regard for the education
of the young, and a gentler assistance of the helpless
and distressed.</p>

<p>True, Cicero, a century and a half before had
preached doctrines that paved the way, and for
generations earlier there had been such a kindlier
spirit in the air. But not until now do we find a
man of Pliny’s dominating prominence, or nearness
to power, suggesting that he will pay a third
of the expenses of the cost of founding a university<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
in his own town. His reason, he says, is to save
youths from going to Milan for their education
and thereby getting away from the proper home
influences.</p>

<p>Tracing the thin thread of child progress through
these livid days we are brought in touch with the
little known but better side of Roman life; for
despite the general debauchery of the upper classes
and the unwholesome pictures of Juvenal, there
is evidence that there were Roman families untouched
by the general immorality where women
of the type of Marcia or Helvia, addressed in the
letters of Seneca, presided over homes in which
there was an atmosphere of virtue and self-restraint,
and where tales of deeds of the Romans of
the earlier days still had their charm and their
influence.</p>

<p>REFORMS OF HADRIAN—PUNISHMENT OF FATHERS—VALERIUS

CHILDREN FOR PROFIT.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>EVER, it has been said, had the human
race enjoyed a state of prosperity equal
to that under the reign of Hadrian, the
successor to Trajan, and like him a philosopher
among emperors. From Nerva to Marcus Aurelius—the
five emperors, Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian,
Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius—there was
a reign of philosophy. Indeed they may also be
called the emperors of the children for the reforms
they accomplished and initiated—working as they
did, contrary to the entire law and tradition of
their country, and without the inspiration of complete
knowledge of the intellectual and spiritual
conditions that were governing them.</p>

<div class="caption">CONSTANTINE THE GREAT, EMPEROR-PROTECTOR OF THE
ROMAN CHILD</div>
</div>

<p>To appreciate all that Hadrian did, one must
remember that he had Plutarch for a master,
Suetonius for his secretary, and Phlegon, his freedman,
as amanuensis to write the history of his
reign. As a youth he had studied all the philosophic
systems including that of Epictetus, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>showed an acquisitive spirit. Had he lived in our
age of private railway cars probably he would
have spent little time at the Capitol: in a time
when travel was both disagreeable and dangerous
he journeyed back and forth over his great domain,
to the dissatisfaction of the Romans, but to his
own greater knowledge of his people and consequent
greater humanitarianism.</p>

<p>Out of that philosophy, that association, and
that teaching, out of the character of Hadrian—for,
despite the attempts of his biographers, Startianus
and Dion Cassius, to make him a cruel and
vain tyrant, his whole life shows an abhorrence of
bloodshed—there was born a new rule.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></p>

<p>He closed the <i>ergastula</i>, or workhouses, where
so many men, carried off by surprise, were detained
and tortured; he protected slaves against the
cruelty and murderous punishments of masters,
prohibiting their sale to houses of prostitution or
schools for gladiators, and also declaring against
the indiscriminate torture of slaves whose masters
had been assassinated. Up to that time even
those who had not been within sight or hearing of
a murder were liable to punishment. A woman
who had ill-treated her female slaves he sentenced
to five years’ imprisonment—an unheard-of thing
in those days.</p>

<p>Once before, during the reign of Tiberius, Carthaginian
priests had been crucified by the Emperor
for the sacrifice of children to their god<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Moloch, but apparently the punishment had not
acted as a deterrent, for we find a similar provision
in the laws of Hadrian.</p>

<p>Going further and, as Duruy says, “employing
logic in the service of humanity,” he ruled that
any woman who had been free at the time of
pregnancy must naturally give birth to a free child,
a ruling not important in itself but closely in
touch with what we will come to see was the argument
of the Christian Fathers in behalf of the lives
of little children.</p>

<p>He ameliorated the condition of women, allowing
them to make wills, and for the first time
softened the law of the Twelve Tables which,
according to Ulpian, had given a mother no rights
in the property of a son dying intestate. Hadrian,
however, following a <i>senatus consultum Tertullianum</i>,
gave the mother, under the <i>jus trium liberorum</i>,
the right to inherit when she had had three
sons, and, if a freed woman, when she had had
four.</p>

<p>But the great blow Hadrian struck at the theories
that had hitherto held sway was the condemning
to banishment a father who had killed
his son. From time immemorial the boast of
Rome had been fathers who, in the ardour of patriotism,
and sometimes in the heat of anger or resentment,
had sacrificed their sons, no matter how
famous or important their sons were.</p>

<div class="caption">THE SACRIFICING OF LIVING INFANTS TO THE GOD MOLOCH</div>
</div>

<p>“Lucius Brutus,” says Valerius Maximus, giving
suitable incidents of the father’s power, “who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>equalled Romulus in honour, for he founded Rome
and thus the Roman liberty, coming to the supreme
power, and understanding that his sons
endeavoured to restore Tarquin, caused them to
be apprehended, and to be whipped with rods
before the Tribuna; and, after that, caused them
to be tied to a stake, and then ordered the sergeant
to cut off their heads. He put off the relation of a
father, that he might act like a consul; rather
chose to live childless, than to be remiss in public
duty.</p>

<p>“Cassius, following his example, though his
son was a tribune of the people, and was the first
that had promulgated the <i>Agrarian</i> law, and by
many other popular acts had won the hearts of the
people, when he had laid down his command, by
advice of his kindred and friends, condemned him
in his own house for affecting the kingdom; and
after he was whipped, commanded him to be put
to death; and consecrated his estate to Ceres.</p>

<p>“Titus Manlius Torquatus, famous for his
many great dignities, and a person of rare experience
in the civil law and the pontifical ceremonies,
did not think it necessary to consult his friends
in an act of the same nature. For when the Macedonians
had by their ambassadors complained to
the Senate of D. Silanus, his son, who was governor
of that province, he besought the Senate
that they would determine nothing in that affair
till he had heard the difference betwixt his son
and the Macedonians. Then, with the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
consent of the conscript fathers, and of them that
came to complain, he sat and heard the cause in
his own house, wherein he spent two whole days
alone, and the third day, after he had diligently
examined the testimonies on both sides, he pronounced
this sentence: ‘Whereas it hath been
proved that Silanus, my son, has taken money of
our allies, I think him unworthy to live either in
the commonwealth, or in my house, and I command
him forthwith to get out of my sight.’ Silanus,
struck with the sharp and cruel sentence of his
father, would not endure to live any longer, but
the next night hanged himself.</p>

<p>“But M. Scaurus, the light and ornament of
his country, when the Roman cavalry was worsted
by the Cimbrians and deserting the proconsul,
Catullus, took their flight toward the city, sent
one to tell his son, who was one of those that fled,
that he had rather meet with his carcass slain in
the field, than see him guilty of such a shameful
flight. And therefore if there were any shame remaining
in his breast, degenerate as he was, he
should shun the sight of his enraged father; for
by the remembrance of his youth, he was admonished
what kind of son was to be owned or
contemned by such a father as Scaurus. Which
message being delivered him, the young man was
forced to make a more fatal use of his sword against
himself, than against his enemies.</p>

<p>“No less imperiously did A. Fulvius, one of the
Senatorian Order, keep back his son from going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
into the field, than Scaurus chid his for running
away. For he caused his son, eminent among his
equals for his wit, learning, and beauty, to be put
to death because he took part with Catiline, being
seduced by ill-counsel; having brought him back
by force, as he was going to Catiline’s army, and
uttering these words before his death, that he ‘did
not beget him to join with Catiline against his
country, but to serve his country against Catiline.’
He might have kept him till the heat of the war
had been over, but that would have been only the
act of a cautious, this was the deed of a severe
father.”</p>

<p>The father who was brought before Hadrian
under the old conditions would have been honoured—he
had killed a son who befouled his name.
Nevertheless this man was ordered to be deported,
“because he had killed as a thief rather than as
one using the power (<i>jure</i>) of father; <i>nam patria
potestas in pietate debet, non atrociate consistere</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a>
Whatever the excuse given, he was punished.
That he had not observed the forms in killing his
son by calling a consultation of the members of
his family, was the nominal reason for punishing
him, but the unchecked power of the father over
the life of his children, even when they had become
adults, was ended.</p>

<p>Modern sensibility will be shocked at the
thought that there had been sufficient social
“advance” for distinct places to become estab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>lished
for the exposure of children. But advance
it was when no longer were children left in unfrequented
highways, no longer were they thrown
into the Tiber.</p>

<p>There were two places where it was the custom to
leave abandoned children. One was near the Velabrum,
a street on the western slope of the Aventine
Hill between the Vicus Tuscus and the Forum
Boarium where the oil dealers and the cheese
mongers made a practice of selling their wares;
and the other, in the vegetable market, where
there rose a column round which the children
were placed. Because of this practice, according
to Festus, the column was called the Lactaria.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a>
It was said that courtesans favoured the Velabrum.</p>

<p>What happened to the children even in this
“advanced” age was doubtless little different
from the treatment they received when they were
found on the highways. The elder Seneca has
given a vivid account of the practice of the day in
the “Thirty-third Controversy,” book five, headed
“Debilitans Expositos.”<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></p>

<p>Difficult as it is to believe that the people who
eventually charged themselves with the rearing
of the foundlings made a business of mutilating
them, there is no doubt but that such was the case.</p>

<p>In the “Controversy” of Seneca the question is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
whether those who mutilated exposed children
have done a wrong toward the State. The debate
is opened by Porcius Latro, who asks if after
having suffered the misfortune of being exposed,
it is not a piece of good luck to have someone
find them.</p>

<p>Cassius Severus then expresses his opinion.</p>

<p>“Look,” he exclaims, “on the blind wandering
about the streets leaning on their sticks, and on
those with crushed feet, and still again look on
those with broken limbs. This one is without
arms, that one has had his shoulders pulled down
out of shape in order that his grotesqueries may
excite laughter. Let us view the entire miserable
family shivering, trembling, blind, mutilated,
perishing from hunger—in fact, already half dead.
Let us go to the origin of all these ills—a laboratory
for the manufacture of human wrecks—a cavern
filled with the limbs torn from living children—each
has a different profession, a different mutilation
has given each a different occupation.”</p>

<p>The conclusion is that inasmuch as the exposed
children are slaves, being the property of those
who rear them, they have no cause for complaint
against the State.</p>

<p>“What wrong has been done to the Republic?”
asks Gallio in reply to Severus. “On the contrary,
have not these children been done a service
inasmuch as their parents had cast them out?”</p>

<p>“Many individuals,” adds F. Claudius, “rid
themselves of misformed children defective in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
part of their body or because the children are
born under evil auspices. Someone else picks
them up out of commiseration and, in order to
defray the expenses of bringing the child up, cuts
off one of its limbs. Today, when they are demanding
charity, that life that they owe to the
pity of one, they are sustaining at the expense
and through the pity of all.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>PROGRESS UNDER THE ANTONINES—FAUSTINA’S EFFORTS
TO SAVE FEMALE CHILDREN—CHRISTIAN
SENTIMENT GROWS—PLEA OF LACTANTIUS—ITS
EFFECTS—CONSTANTINE.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>ROM the strictly legal side the most interesting
event of Hadrian’s reign is the fact
that the opinions of the jurists, when they
were unanimous, were now recognized as written
law.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> The constitutions or proclamations of law
of the emperors, although none were ascribed to
an earlier date, had probably been issued for a
century previously, but now what is called the
“Perpetual Edict” is finally arranged and authorized,
and law proceeds from an intellectual and
philosophic source, instead of from an imperial
head.</p>

<p>In empowering Salvius Julianus, one of the
four greatest lawyers Rome ever produced, to
frame an edict, and by a <i>senatus consultum</i> embody
this edict in the statute law of Rome, the
entire law of the Empire underwent a change in
spirit. What had hitherto been done by Augustus,
by Nerva, by Trajan, and by Hadrian himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
had furnished only the value of example or of an
immediate law passed for the benefit of some particular
condition. A succeeding emperor was at
liberty to imitate or pass similar laws, or ignore
the acts of his predecessors as he might choose.
As we shall see, he usually ignored the noble examples
of those who had gone before.</p>

<p>But by placing the making of the law in the
hands of the jurists, men who were thinkers and
scholars and under the influence of the spreading
Stoic philosophy, many disciples of Zeno and
Chrysippus, and some later to be under the influence
of the Christian philosophy, Hadrian was
laying a broad foundation for the complete passing
of the Roman idea of the unimportance of the
child as a child, and making way for the Christian
idea which was to take its place.</p>

<p>By a <i>senatus consultum</i>, passed before the Edict
of Julianus, the right of fathers to expose their
children was for the first time taken away; <i>durante
matrimonio</i> they were compelled to rear their
children instead of exposing them, while later
regulations made it necessary to maintain even
those children born after divorce.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a></p>

<p>This was the first attempt to prohibit the exposing
of children.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the right of the father to reject
his offspring was restricted in earliest times to
weak and deformed children, and then only after
there had been a conference with five neighbours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
but the frequent reference to the exposure of children
under the Republic and under the emperors
indicates that there was little regard for this legal
restraint. Even Augustus himself did not hesitate
to expose the child of his granddaughter.</p>

<p>The law of Hadrian has not been placed by
scholars and commentators as the first law against
exposing children, partly no doubt because it was
too new to be really effective. In an interesting
controversy<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> between Gerardus Noodt and Cornelius
Van Binkershoek, as to whether there were
any prohibitory laws prior to those of Valentinian,
Valens, and Gratian (367 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>), Binkershoek maintains
with great show of authority, what is undoubtedly
true, that there were. Interesting, too,
is the fact that we find in the Code of Justinian
(vii., 16, 1) reference to a rescript of Hadrian in
which the sale of children is referred to as “<i>res
illicita et inhonesta</i>,” which is assumed by Walker
to refer to the sales not being properly conducted,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a>
but which, judging from the temper of the Emperor,
referred to the thing itself.</p>

<p>As the war-loving Trajan was succeeded by the
lover of peace, the nomadic Hadrian was succeeded
by the home-loving Antoninus Pius, who did not
leave Rome for almost a quarter of a century,
except for one rapid tour through Asia. He made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
it possible for children to inherit from their parents
even though they had neglected to imitate a
father in becoming a Roman citizen. He further
showed his humanity by compelling cruel masters
to sell slaves they had maltreated.</p>

<p>In the name of his wife, Faustina, for whom—despite
the assaults on her character—he retained
ever affection and respect, he consecrated a protective
foundation for the benefit of girls, <i>puellæ
alimentariæ Faustinianæ</i>—the first of its kind in the
world, and the initial move to save female children
other than the first-born. A medal of the time,
showing the Empress, bears on the reverse side
Antoninus surrounded by children, with the words
<i>Puellæ Faustinianæ</i> in the exergue.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> This, together
with his continuous support of the <i>pueri alimentarii</i>,
entitles him to the credit of saving more children
from the “ancient and abominable” custom of
being thrown out on the crossroads to die than
any of his predecessors.</p>

<p>At the end of his reign it is evident from the
inscriptions that endowments similar to those
originated by Nerva had been made at Atina,
Abellinum, Abella, Vibo, Caieta, Anagnia, Fundi,
Cupra Montana, Industria, Brixia, Aquileia,
Compsa, Æclanum, Allifæ, Aufidena, Cures, Auximum,
and other places. What is more interesting
than the point of view of E. E. Bryant, in his
<i>Life of Antoninus Pius</i>, that these “endowments
undoubtedly pauperized Italians and lightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
unwisely the responsibility of parents for the
maintenance of their children? But they <i>must
certainly have been of assistance to farmers</i>, and have
supplied them with the capital necessary for
successful agriculture.”<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></p>

<p>The progress made in the matter of child history
would be incomplete if one did not recall that in
this reign appeared that bold and able defender
of Christianity, Justin Martyr. The time had
gone by for darkness and seclusion, and now, that
which had been contemptuously but so well described
as the religion of “slaves and women, of
children and old men,” strode abroad, proclaiming
its right to be heard as a rational and uplifting
doctrine. Pleading for the oppressed and the
downtrodden, pleading for those the Roman world
affected to despise, preaching a religion of humility—there
is a fine, robust, masculine note in Justin’s
opening words of his apology, the challenging
conviction of a man who knowingly throws down
the gauntlet to the masters of the world.</p>

</p>

<p>It was during the reign of Antoninus that Tertullian
was born.</p>

<p>Under Antoninus’s philosophic successor the
alimentary institution was further developed,
Marcus Aurelius showing his interest by putting
the supervision under a person of prætorian or
consular rank.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> He upheld the rights of children,
going one step further in the direction of freedom
by ending the tyrannical power of the father to
oblige his son to put away his wife, if the latter
were disagreeable to the head of the family.</p>

<p>With Marcus Aurelius vanished the humane
emperors—they had reigned long. Culminating
in his beneficent sway the Stoic philosophy, from
Aristotle to Marcus Aurelius, kept developing,
in the midst of surroundings the least encouraging.
The Stoics, with their ideas of humanity, of mutual
good will and moral equality, arrived at almost
the same conclusions regarding religion and the
same sentiment regarding humanity as did the
followers of the Christian religion, although working
from an entirely different source. The one
reached its conclusion through the medium of
patrician orators, philosophers, and emperors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
the other through the slaves, the distressed, and
those for whom life faced an unbroken wall.</p>

<p>From Aurelius to Septimus Severus there is
little but bloodshed in Roman history. The selection
of Papinian, the greatest of Roman jurists,
as his adviser is in a way the greatest claim to fame
that Severus has.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> Among his many laws was
one that permitted the sons of a condemned criminal
to retain the rights the father had over freedmen,
which was considered a great indulgence—<i>benignissime
rescripsit</i>. He condemned to temporary
exile the woman who, by practising abortion,
had deprived her husband of the hope of
children.</p>

<p>Of the bloody reign of Caracalla it is to be noted
principally that he changed the <i>lex Julia</i> in such
a way as to deprive paternity of its privileges.
Those who were not married (<i>cœlebs</i>) and those
who were married and had no children (<i>orbus</i>)
suffered in regard to their inheritances as they
had under the old law, but Caracalla filled his
treasury by sweeping into the <i>fiscus</i> all the <i>caduca</i>.</p>

<p>While the barbarians are now beginning to press
down on the northern frontiers of the Empire and
the Christians beginning to rapidly and swiftly
permeate the vast domain, there is little but a
bloody chronicle of making and unmaking of emperors
up to Diocletian. Even when persecuted
and proscribed, says Ortolan, Christianity had a
liberalizing and softening effect on the progress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
jurisprudence and legislation. The softening effect
was also the effect of a new understanding. Trajan,
one of the greatest of the humane emperors,
had come from Spain, and Diocletian, who temporarily
braced up the Roman legions, put energy
into the government, and held the barbarians in
check, was himself from a family of freedmen.
The best of the patrician blood had become thoroughly
impregnated with Stoic ideas, although it
was true that the jurists who had obtained their
philosophy from Greece and were given the task
of defending existing law and institutions were
still against the new religion. Though the persecutors
under Diocletian were unusually severe,
theirs was the final burst of oppression before
the new religion was to triumph in having the
head of the great Roman Empire, Diocletian’s
own successor, Constantine, accept the despised
faith.</p>

<p>It matters little whether Constantine’s conversion
was a political move, based on a desire to
absorb a growing and powerful organization.
This was a century in which things were happening
and his was a reign (306 or 313–337) that
marked a long turn in the road in the attitude of
the State toward the child. Despite the progress
that had been made, the practice of murdering
and exposing new-born children was becoming
more and more frequent in the provinces, and
especially in Italy.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<p>It was due to poverty, says Gibbon,<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> and the
principal causes of distress were the unendurable
taxes. The historian declares that “moved by
some recent and extraordinary instances of despair,”
Constantine addressed an edict<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> to all the
cities of Italy and afterward to those of Africa,
directing that immediate and sufficient aid be
given by magistrates to parents who produced
children that they were too poor to bring up.
Against the opinion of Gibbon is set that of Godefroy
that it was not some unusual bit of misery,
some “Mary Ellen case,” that moved the Emperor
to take this significant step.</p>

<p>The edict was published on May 12, 315 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>,
a few months before his victory over Licinius.
The Christians had prophesied to Constantine
that he would be victorious and he was more than
likely to be influenced by their point of view, especially
that of Lactantius, the noted rhetorician
and teacher, to whom he had entrusted the education
of his son, Crispus. Lactantius had just
written his work on <i>The Divine Institutes</i>, designed
to supersede the less complete treatises of Minucius
Felix, Tertullian, and Cyprian. He had dedicated
the work to Constantine, and perhaps had
conversed with him about it, discussing one particular
chapter in which the Christian Father had
inveighed, with his accustomed grace but with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
unusual force, against infanticide and the sale
and exposure of infants. A new day, indeed, had
come—the proud Emperor of the mighty Romans
sits high on his throne, listening to, and moved by—a
Christian Father!</p>

<p>This is Lactantius’s plea for the new-born, from
the sixth book of his <i>Divine Institutes</i><a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a>:</p>

<p>“Therefore let no one imagine that even this
is allowed, to strangle newly born children, which
is the greatest impiety; for God breathes into their
souls for life, and not for death. But men, that
there may be no crime with which they may not
pollute their hands, deprive souls, as yet innocent
and simple, of the light which they themselves
have not given. Any one truly may not expect
that they would abstain from the blood of others
who do not abstain even from their own. But
these are without any controversy wicked and
unjust. What are they whom a false piety compels
to expose their children? Can they be considered
innocent who expose their own offspring
as a prey to dogs, and as far as it depends upon
themselves, kill them in a more cruel manner than
if they had strangled them?</p>

<p>“Who can doubt that he is impious who gives
occasion for the pity of others? For, although
that which he has wished should befall the child—namely,
that it should be brought up—he has
certainly consigned his own offspring either to
servitude or to the brothel? But who does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
understand, who is ignorant what things may
happen, or are accustomed to happen, in the case
of each sex, even through error? For this is
shown by the example of Œdipus alone, confused
with twofold guilt. It is therefore as wicked to
expose as it is to kill. But truly parricides complain
of the scantiness of their means, and allege
that they have not enough for bringing up more
children; as though, in truth, their means were in
the power of those who possess them, or God did
not daily make the rich poor, and the poor rich.
Wherefore, if any one on account of poverty shall
be unable to bring up children, it is better to
abstain from marriage than with wicked hands to
mar the work of God.”</p>

<p>As an additional protective measure Constantine
withdrew the right of liberty that the Antonines
had secured to foundling children, and in order
to encourage strangers to pick up waifs cast away
by parents, the Emperor made them the slaves
of those who raised them. The father was punished
for rejecting his infant by being no longer
able to claim a right that had previously been his.
Rather than that there should be murder, the
Emperor went further; he gave poor parents the
right to sell their new-born children.</p>

<p>One more step and the story of the Roman child
ends. The Emperor Valentinian, a strange mixture
of cruelty and sense—the same who kept two
ferocious she-bears near him and saw that they
had human food a-plenty,—is in the books as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
author of the law condemning the exposition of
new-born infants. It was in 374 that this edict
was issued in the name of the Emperors Valentinian,
Valens, and Gratian, declaring that whosoever
should expose his children should be subject to
punishment.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><br />

<small>PLEAS OF THE CHRISTIAN FATHERS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T has been said that the only way to understand
the Middle Ages is to comprehend that the
Roman Empire did not die down, or fade
away; it remained, or continued to be the centre
of civilized government, until comparatively recent
times. In fact, nominally the Holy Roman
Empire, the direct descendant of the Roman
Empire, did not pass away as an idea until 1806,
when the Emperor Joseph II. announced to the
Germanic Diet his refusal to carry any longer the
title of Emperor of the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></p>

<p>Even when the Roman Empire was at its greatest
point of power and wealth, the actual founders
of the Holy Roman Empire were at work in Rome
itself, in the persons of the Christian Fathers; for,
after all, it was the Church that was to rule the
world once swayed by Roman legions. The men
who, as representatives of Christ, were later to
tame the barbarians, really laid the foundations
for the future greatness of Christian Rome, amid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
the very luxury and opulence of the pagan Rome
soon to pass away.</p>

<p>The struggles of these Christians among the
polished and cruel Romans was, in a way, a preparation
for the struggle to come later with the
unpolished, but equally cruel, barbarians. In
their conquest of the Roman world, the Christian
founders saved their religion; in the conquest of the
barbarian hordes, they saved civilization; without
Christianity the German and Celtic races, with
their lustful, revengeful, and passionate natures,
either might have overwhelmed Roman civilization
entirely, bringing on a night of barbarism, or
have been themselves “corrupted and destroyed by
the vices and sensuality which surrounded them.”<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></p>

<p>Amid all the differences of opinion and doctrine
that we find among the early founders of Christianity,
there was one thing on which they were unanimous,
and that was the attitude toward children.
It was a ceaseless war they waged in behalf of
children—those early and ofttimes eloquent founders.
From Barnabas, contemporary of the Apostles,
and by Luke even called one of them, to
Ambrosius and Augustine, they did not cease to
denounce those who, no matter what their reasons,
exposed or killed infants.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_fp258.jpg" width="500" height="730" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“SUFFER THE LITTLE CHILDREN TO COME UNTO ME”</div>
</div>

<p>No distinction was made by the Fathers between
infanticide and exposure.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> Both were murderous
acts, particularly bitterly condemned by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>Christians because their enemies had charged them
with murdering infants at secret rites. The letter
attributed to Barnabas by Clement of Alexandria
and Origen, and which in any case goes back to the
earliest days of the religion, severely condemned
infanticide. “Thou shalt not slay the child by
procuring abortion, nor again shalt thou destroy
it after it is born.”<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> By such protests as these,
made with one cannot tell what frequency, the
Christians took their stand on the basic principles.</p>

<p>Justin, whose vigorous manner of addressing
the Emperor is so attractive, succumbed, at the
age of seventy-four, to the calumnies of the cynic
Crescentius, and became a martyr; but his example
and fervour left an indelible mark upon his time.</p>

<p>“As for us,” he says, “we have been taught that
to expose newly born children is the part of
wicked men; and this we have been taught lest
we should do any one an injury, and lest we should
sin against God; first, because we see that almost
all so exposed (not only the girls, but also the
males) are brought up to prostitution.... Now
we see you rear children only for this shameful
use; and for this pollution a multitude of females
and hermaphrodites, and those who commit unmentionable
iniquities are found in every nation.
And you receive the hire of these, and duty and
taxes from them, whom you ought to exterminate
from your realm.”<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>And again he says: “We fear to expose children,
lest some of them be not picked up, but die,
and we become murderers. But whether we
marry, it is only that we may bring up children;
or whether we decline marriage, we live continently.”<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></p>

<p>Athanagoras,<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> the Athenian philosopher, who
presented to Marcus Aurelius and to Commodus
an apology for the Christians, in 166 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>, asked
the logical Romans to use their famous common
sense in weighing false charges made against
Christians.</p>

<p>“What man of sound mind,” he said, “will
affirm that we, who abhor murder, are murderers;
we who condemn as murder the use of drugs for
abortion, and declare that those who even expose
a child are chargeable with murder.”<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></p>

<p>Tertullian, whose apology was written in the
year 200, or 205, of our era, was equally bold.</p>

<p>“Riders of the Roman Empire,” he began,
“seated for the administration of justice on your
lofty tribunal”—and then made the charge direct:
“You first of all expose your children, that they
may be taken up by any compassionate passer-by,
to whom they are quite unknown; or you give
them away to be adopted by those who will act
better to them the part of parents.”<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<p>Later, in another address, this time to the pagan
people, he returns to the charges.</p>

<p>“Although you are forbidden by the laws to
slay new-born infants, it so happens that no laws
are evaded with more impunity or greater safety,
with the deliberate knowledge of the public and
the suffrages of this entire age, ... You make
away with them in a more cruel manner, because
you expose them to cold and hunger, and to wild
beasts, or else you get rid of them by the slower
death of drowning [<i>sic</i>].”<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></p>

<p>“Man is more cruel to his offspring than animals,”
said the learned Clement of Alexandria.
“Orpheus tamed the tiger by his songs, but the
God of the Christians, in calling men to their true
religion, did more, since he tamed and softened
the most ferocious of all animals—men themselves.”<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">377</a></p>

<p>No abler pleader for the new order of things
was there than Minucius Felix, a Roman lawyer
of education, who, on his conversion to the new
faith, became one of the eloquent founders of
Latin Christianity. A disciple of Cicero, he has
been called the “precursor of Lactantius in the
graces of style.”</p>

<p>“How I should like to meet him,” he exclaims,
indignantly, “who says or believes that we are
initiated by the slaughter and blood of an infant
... no one can believe this except one who can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
dare do it. And I see that you at one time exposed
your begotten children to wild beasts and
to birds; and another, that you crush them when
strangled with a miserable kind of death ...
and these things assuredly come down from the
teachings of your gods. For Saturn did not expose
his children, but devoured them. With reason
were infants sacrificed to him by parents in some
part of Africa, caresses and kisses repressing their
crying, that a weeping victim might not be sacrificed.
Moreover, among the Tauri of Pontus,
and to the Egyptian Busiris, it was a sacred rite
to immolate their guests, and for the Galli to
slaughter to Mercury human, or rather inhuman,
sacrifices. The Roman sacrifices buried living
a Greek man and a Greek woman, a Gallic man
and a Gallic woman; and to this day, Jupiter
Latiaris is worshipped by them with murder;
and, what is worthy of the son of Saturn, he is
gorged with the blood of an evil and criminal
man.”<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a></p>

<p>To drive home the awful character of a crime
that was so common we have the vision of Paul,
who sees the man and woman who have exposed
children, suffering in hell the terrible tortures of
the damned.</p>

<p>“‘They [the parents] gave us for food to dogs
and to be turned out to swine. Some of us they
threw into the river,’ exclaimed these children;
“and so now the guilty are condemned to eternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
punishment while the children are committed to
the angels.”<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></p>

<p>We have quoted already the eloquent Lactantius.
Basil the Great thundered against infanticide
and the spectacle of free children being sold
by avaricious creditors of their fathers. The
same Ambrosius, who, although only a Christian
Bishop, castigated the Emperor Theodosius for
the massacre at Thessalonica, brought his force
and courage to play against the law which permitted
a debtor to satisfy his claim, at the cost
of the liberty of his son, or the debauchery of his
daughter, as the <i>fisc</i> was then authorized to sell
infants to pay unsatisfied taxes.</p>

<p>A new religion in one of the least important
provinces of the Roman Empire, Christianity, in
three centuries, pushed its doctrines to the very
end of the vast Roman domain, and even made the
conquest of the imperial throne itself.</p>

<p>Its impassioned preachers and apostles vaunted
the humanity of their new faith; for cast-out infants
and the despised slaves the new priests
fought such a battle of perseverance and martyrdom
as the world had never seen before.</p>

<p>In the name of their new God, Jesus, himself
admittedly a poor Jew and a carpenter, they took
all the truth there was in the aristocratic philosophy
of the Romans and their emperors, and
made it live indeed—they applied it to the lowest,
and the most humble—even to children. “No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>thing
human is alien”—this was a verity in the
lives of the men who fought the first battles of
Christianity.</p>

<p>Every human being had a soul—that was a
vital point in their fight. They asserted that
children had souls, to which religious doctrine
probably more is due in the way of checking the
practice of infanticide than any other single idea.
We have seen how Plutarch, the polished philosopher,
had gone as far as the pagan mind could
under its philosophy, in directing thought as
to man’s responsibility for actions toward the
child, by collecting opinions of the philosophers
as to when an unborn child became a human
being.</p>

<p>The Fathers won the battle in that they convinced
the Roman world that children had souls—but
the economic battle was one not yet to be
won by preaching. But it was not by orations and
preaching alone that they had won as much as
they had.</p>

<p>Constantine, in the year 315, as we have seen,
had put forth the proclamation:</p>

<p>“Let a law be at once promulgated in all the
towns of Italy, to turn parents from using a parricidal
hand on their new-born children, and to
dispose their hearts to the best sentiments. Watch
with care over this, that, if a father brings his
child, saying that he cannot support it, someone
should supply him without delay with food and
clothing; for the cares of the new-born suffer no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
delay, and we order that our revenue, as well as
our treasure, aid in this expense.”<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></p>

<p>To this he added, in 321, including the provinces:</p>

<p>“We have learned that the inhabitants of provinces,
suffering from scarcity of food, sell and put
in pledge their children. We command then that
those found in this situation, without any personal
resource, and being able only with great trouble
to support their children, be succoured by our
treasury before they fall under the blows of poverty;
for it is repugnant to our morals that any
one under our Empire should be pushed by hunger
to commit a crime.”<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a></p>

<p>Ten years later, Constantine had to modify
the laws in relation to children—so acute were
the sufferings in the Empire—by permitting those
who “took up” children to have the right of
property in them.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a></p>

<p>“Whoever,” said Constantine in his latest law,
“has taken in a new-born boy or girl, exposed by
the order and with the knowledge of its father or
master, outside of the house of the one or the other,
has the power to keep him as son or slave without
fear that those who rejected him can reclaim him.”</p>

<p>The conditions of the times, as Dugour points
out, are well shown by the frequency with which
these conditions are referred to. Julius Firmicus,
an astrologer of the fourth century, devotes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
chapter of his work to revealing combinations of
planets that will tell what will be the fate of the
child that is exposed. Under certain signs the
child will perish through lack of food; under others
it will drown; under still another it will be eaten
by dogs, and another combination indicated that
it would find a saviour and a second father.</p>

<p>In 374, the Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and
Gratian declared that the exposure of all infants
was punishable, and ordered that parents see to
it that their children were fed. The main question
that seemed to agitate both the Empire of
the East and the Empire of the West was that of
the rights of the adoptive parent, as against those
who owned the land where the child had been
abandoned.</p>

<p>“Let men look to it that they nourish their
children. If they expose them, they may be
punished in conformity with the law. If other
persons take the children up they cannot be reclaimed;
as people cannot take again children
they have wilfully permitted to perish.”</p>

<p>In 391, Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius
permitted, by other law, the child sold by its
father to become a free man after a short term of
servitude, without reimbursing a master.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></p>

<p>In 409, Honorius and Theodosius issued an
edict in favour of Romans sold to other Romans,
limiting the period of slavery to five years. Nevertheless,
in 412, Honorius and Theodosius confirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
the law of Constantine concerning the sale of
infants purchased or taken up with the knowledge
of the bishop of the diocese.</p>

<p>An edict of the emperors maintained the rights
of the adoptive parents. The right of the latter
to their property was also confirmed in cases
where the parent or master willingly and knowingly
had allowed the child to be exposed.</p>

<p>Another imperial edict ordered that no new-born
could be taken from the place where it had
been found without the presence of witnesses.
A form was drawn up which was to be signed by
the bishop.</p>

<p>In 438, these regulations were collected by
Theodosius the Second under the Code that bears
his name.</p>

<p>In 451, Valentinian the Third declared that the
<i>nutritor</i>, or person who had taken up the child,
should receive an indemnity, independent of the
years of service, and fixed the price to be paid him.
The Emperor also declared that those who had
sold children to barbarians, or who had purchased
a free person for the purpose of transporting him
across seas, should be compelled to pay to the
<i>fisc</i>, six ounces of gold.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></p>

<p>Following the preachings of the Fathers, and
supplementing and strengthening the laws of the
Empire, the Church at various councils, called
always for some other purpose, took action and
frequently condemned the loose morals of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p>Not orations, nor apologies and pleas alone,
says Labourt, would have brought about the new
point of view among people so hard pressed and
so thoroughly imbued with the ideas of another
civilization. At the Council of Ancyra, the modern
city of Angora, in the year 314, it was decreed
that the woman guilty of killing her offspring
should be punished by being forbidden to enter
a church for the rest of her life, a terrible punishment
in those days.</p>

<p>At the Council of Elvira, the first one held in
Spain, by some held to have met before 250, but
by Tillemont placed in the year 300, a decree
limited the period of retribution to ten years, of
which two were to be passed in weeping, at the
end of which time the recreant mother could
receive the sacraments.</p>

<p>At a Council in 546, the period of penitence
was reduced to seven years. At the Council of
Constantinople, in 588, or 592, the crime was
compared to homicide, and finally Sixtus Quintus
and Gregory the Fourteenth stated that the
culprits should suffer capital punishment.</p>

<p>At the Council of Nicaea, in 325,—the famous
council at which a controversy between Bishop
Arius and Bishop Athanasius was “settled,” with
the result that Arius was declared a heretic,—it was
prescribed, in Article Seventy of its conclusions,
that in each village of the Christian world there
should be established an asylum, under the name
of the <i>Xenodocheion</i>, the object of which was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
assist voyageurs, the sick, and the poor. Without
doubt, as Labourt suggests, these places became
asylums for abandoned children.</p>

<p>The question of the property right was one that
the Church had to face in the Council of Vaison,
in 442. Frequently after charitable strangers
had taken children off the highways, educated
them, and brought them up, their parents or their
owners would demand their return. It was a
vital question of the day: to whom did these
children belong?</p>

<p>The Emperor Constantine had declared that
those who received them had a right to them and
the Emperor Honorius had added the restriction
that the Church must know of the adoption.
Many were the arguments and the legal battles
that ensued, during which time people were little
inclined to rescue the abandoned infants and
many perished as victims of the voracity of dogs,
many as the victims of hunger and cold.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>These conditions were presented to the Council,
which ordered the following measures:</p>

<p>“Whoever takes up an abandoned child shall
bring him to the Church where that fact will be
certified. The following Sunday the priest will
announce that a new-born child has been found
and ten days will be allowed to the real parents
to claim their infant. When these formalities
have been complied with, if any one then claims
a child or in any way calumniates those who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
received it, he will be punished according to the
Church laws against homicide.”<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></p>

<p>Ten years later the act of the Council of Vaison
was sanctioned at the Council of Arles and again
in 505, by the Council of Agde.</p>

<p>It has been said that this was comparatively
little when one thinks of this great union of bishops
representing not only the interests of religion but
“the moral needs of the epoch.” On the other
hand, any criticism would be unjust that did not
take into consideration the fact that it was great
progress in the face of great poverty and greater
barbarity.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></p>

<p>Church and State united in the movement for
the protection of the child in the laws of Justinian,
who, raised to the throne in 527, published in 529,
and with considerable changes in 534, a collection
of laws that have immortalized his name, in which
the great lawyer Tribonian remade the three other
codes, the Gregorian, Hermogenian, and the
Theodosian.</p>

<p>Justinian proclaimed absolute liberty for foundling
children, declaring that they were not the
property of either the parents who exposed them
or of those who received them.</p>

<p>One of these laws, promulgated in 553, punished
severely those who tried to hold as slaves, children
who had been exposed. This law stated expressly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
that all children left at churches or other places
were absolutely free. It also stated that the act
of exposing a child exceeded the cruelty of an
ordinary murder, inasmuch as it struck at the
most feeble and the most pitiable.</p>

<p>The imperial edict of 553 invited the Archbishop
of Thessalonica and the prefect to give to the
foundlings all the help possible and to punish those
who disobeyed the injunction with a fine of five
livres of gold. In addition, the Justinian Code
contained a provision by which a father whose
poverty was extreme was allowed to sell his son
or his daughter at the moment of birth and to
repurchase the infant later. The Emperor also
ordered that some organized endeavour be made
to take care of children for whom no other provision
had been made. Unchanged and little modified,
with the exception of those amendments
made by the Emperor Leon, the philosopher,
these laws and these conditions governed the
Eastern Empire from now on until its fall before
the arms of the Turks.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH Church and State united in defence
of the child’s right to live, we turn to
the barbaric hordes that were then enfilading
the Roman civilization. For the first
time in the history of man the religious law was
the same as the civil law, and for the first time in
the history of man both represented human law.</p>

<p>With Diocletian’s division of the Empire into
four almost equal parts under two Augusti and
two Cæsars, there was frank acknowledgment that
the great Roman Empire was at an end. With
him, too, ended the fiction of a popular sovereignty.
The Roman Emperor became an Eastern despot.
He was no longer a man of the people easily to
be seen and showing his democracy in frequent
unofficial parade.</p>

<p>He was now a secluded person wearing the dress
of the Orientals, surrounded by servile officials;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>and the Orientalism of the government went
further when Constantine, at the farthest limit
of Europe, built a new city, Constantinople,
named after himself. Nominally it was but to
divide with Rome the honours of being the capital;
in reality it was to dim the even now fading lustre
of the Seven Hills.</p>

<p>From the frontiers of China to the Baltic there
came pressing down on the fast disintegrating
Roman Empire armies of barbarians. Amid all
the disorder, the calamities without number,
when civilization, science, and the arts were all
obscured, the Church gained strength, its tenets
held sway, its humanities were accepted as the
conquerors in their turn became the conquered.
The Christian religion slowly gripped them all as
out of the convulsions of government there was
born the modern Europe.</p>

<p>To the Romans and their adopted allies it was
a world of terror—to the Christians it was a
friendly world, for the barbarians were known to
the Church long before they were known to the
soldiers who tried to repulse them.</p>

<p>It has been the fashion to decry the value of the
check that the Church put on the barbarous tribes
in the early part of the Christian era.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> Up to the
very door of the Church there was, it is true,
slaughter—there it stopped. Had it not been for
the Church upholding what it did of civilization
and humanity, it is difficult to say what would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
have been the outcome of the hordes of Ostrogoths,
Visigoths, Gephids, Longobards, Vandals,
Burgundians, Franks, and Saxons who, at one time
or another, fell upon Rome.</p>

<p>But from the third century these invaders in
their very triumph came face to face with a moral
force that checked them as no army could, softened
their manners, and uniting their rude strength with
the last remains of the glory of Rome, gave to the
world the civilized nations that now practically
control both hemispheres.</p>

<p>Of the first missionary efforts little is known.
Jesus himself had said, “Go ye therefore and teach
all nations.... Teach them to observe all things
whatsoever I have commanded you,”<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> and was
indeed himself the first missionary of the new faith.
Of his immediate followers only three undertook
missionary work.</p>

<p>After the death of Jesus, the Apostles scattered
over the whole world. “Thomas,” says Eusebius,
“received Parthia as his alloted region; Andrew
received Scythia, and John, Asia.... Peter appears
to have preached through Pontus, Galatia,
Bithynia, Cappadocia, and Asia ... and Paul
spread the Gospel from Jerusalem to Illyricum.”<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a></p>

<p>From another source we are told that Matthew
went into Æthiopia, but in the following century
there is little light as to who were the missionaries;
but that they were everywhere successful is shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
by the reports of the Roman governors to the
emperors. Undisputed claims of Tertullian and
Justin also show that the work of conversion,
despite the proscriptions, was going on rapidly
enough. Ulfilas, “the Apostle of the Goths,”
translated the Bible into their language in 325;
Eusebius, Bishop of Vercelli in 370, made his
cathedral the centre of missionary work. Chrysostom
trained people in the Gothic language and
in missionary work and sent them among the Goths
according to Theodoretius.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a></p>

<p>It was harder work in the West but it was more
lasting. From Berins, an islet off the roadstead
of Toulon where, in 410 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>, a Roman patrician,
Honoratus, had founded a monastic home, there
were sent bishops to Arles, Avignon, Lyons, Troyes,
Metz, and Nice, and many other places in southern
and western Gaul, all to become the centres of
missionary work.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></p>

<p>The proselyting spirit among these Frankish
bishops gave rise to a great movement in the
north. The preaching of Patrick was followed by
what has been described as a marvellous burst of
enthusiasm; and Celtic enthusiasm was from now
to be counted on. Columba, the founder of Iona,
was the missionary for the Northern Picts and the
Albanian Scots; Aidan for the Northumbrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Saxons; Columbanus for the Burgundians of the
Vosges; Callich or Gallus for north-eastern Switzerland
and Germany; Kilian for Thuringia;
Virgilius for Carinthia; Fridolin in Suabia and
Alsace; Magnoald founded a monastery in Fingen;
Trudpert penetrated as far as the Black Forest,
where he was killed.</p>

<p>Among these people there had been a variety
of conditions before the coming of, first the Romans,
and secondly the Christians. Before the arrival
of St. Patrick and the conversion of the natives
there is very little doubt that part of the pagan
worship included human sacrifice. On a plain
in what is now the county of Leitrim which was
then called the Magh-Sleacth, or Field of Slaughter,
these primeval rites took place.</p>

<p>“There on the night of Samhin, the same dreadful
tribute which the Carthaginians are known to
have paid to Saturn in sacrificing to him their
first-born, was by the Irish offered up to their
chief idol, Crom-Cruach.”<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></p>

<p>Of the Gauls and the Germans we learn something
from Cæsar and Tacitus, but both are vague
enough when it comes to the subject of children.
The two people, according to Strabo, were as much
alike as brothers.</p>

<p>“The two races have much in common,” said
Martin, “in their social organization.” In Gaul
the power of the father was absolute—<i>viri in
uxores sicut in liberos vitæ necisque habent potesta</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span><i>tem</i>,
wrote Cæsar, and Tacitus tells us in <i>Germanicus</i>
that the husband had assisted in the execution
of his adulterous wife by her nearest relatives—a
condition that would lead one to believe that
there was high regard for the mother of the family,
although it has been said that Tacitus in painting
the Germans as virtuous as he did<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> was following
much along the lines of Fenimore Cooper in painting
the Indians a holy pink—he wished to improve
the morals of his own countrymen and sacrificed
truth as a detaining cargo.</p>

<p>The Germans of the fourth century represented
about the period of culture that our American
Indians did when the English first arrived in this
country. Unlike the Indians, they had the power
to learn, whereas the Indians seemed to be able to
learn only the vices of civilization. Their imagination
stirred by the stories that came back to
them of the glory of Rome, they were for pressing
forward. With the growing population that made
migration necessary, and with the inimical forces
pushing them from the rear, the “open road”
beckoned them on to Rome.</p>

<p>Before the close of the fourth century the Gospel
had been carried to them, especially to those near
the Roman border.</p>

<p>We have seen the laws of old Rome become
more humane—what were the laws of this later
Rome?</p>

<p>Among some of the German tribes, notably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
among the Frisians, we learn that the father had
the right to kill and expose his children when he
was unable to provide them with nourishment;
but once the child had taken of milk or eaten
honey it could not be killed. The Emperor Julian,
who loved literature more than he loved religion
and has been decorated with the title Apostate,
speaks of a custom of some of the barbarians who
lived on the banks of the Rhine, which consisted
of abandoning the new-born children on the waves
of the river, believing that adulterous children
would drown and legitimate children would
survive.</p>

<p>The Church was here able “to concord the essentials
of two bodies of law by discarding the
elements of formalism and egoism in the Roman
law and the hard and barbaric qualities of the
German law; and introduced as governing principles
of social and communal life the grave moral
principles which Christ had proclaimed. The
New Testament was the great law, the legislative
ideal for all the Romano-Germanic peoples.”<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></p>

<p>In the semi-barbarian laws that came out as
the result of the blending of their own customs
with the Roman law, the combined product being
softened by the Christian teaching, there is evident
always the Germanic idea of the <i>wergeld</i> by
which a man paid for a crime, from the smallest
to the greatest. And instead of the <i>patria potestas</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
we find the <i>mundium</i>, this word (hand) being
used to describe all classes of protection.</p>

<p>Infanticide is not mentioned as frequently as
is abortion. To the belief that the infant had a
soul was traceable this phase of semi-barbarian
legislation.</p>

<p>The Franks were not spoken of in history until
240 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> (Aurelianus) and Salian Franks whose
laws Montesquieu declared were much quoted
and seldom read were subdued by Julianus.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></p>

<p>According to the Salic law<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> to “kill a child that
did not as yet have a name, that is to say one under
eight days of age, was to be subject to a fine or
<i>wergeld</i> of 100 sous or 4000 deniers”<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> xxiii., 4.
<i>Si utero in ventre matris sui occisus fuerit, aut ante
quod nomen abait, malb anneando, sunt din. iiiM
fac. sol. culp. iud.</i></p>

<p>To kill a boy under ten, according to the early
manuscripts, meant a fine of 24,000 deniers, while
the later manuscripts raised the age to twelve, as
there was greater <i>wergeld</i> for killing one who was
then considered a man. Oghlou suggests that
while it cost but 200 sous to kill an ordinary free
man, the price of an infant under twelve was 600<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
because “the cowardice of killing a child that
had not arrived at the twelfth year appealed to
the barbarians.” Such an interpretation would
be crediting the Salians with a most humanitarian
and nineteenth-century point of view. As a
matter of fact, the fine for the murder of a child
is the same as for the killing of a <i>sagbaron</i> (<i>Dicuntur
quosi senatores</i>).</p>

<p>The words <i>puer crintus</i> have been shown by
Kern<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> to refer not to the fact that the boy was one
of twelve years who had been allowed to wear his
hair long, but one who “by right of birth is allowed
to wear his hair long in contradistinction to
slaves and serfs.”<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a></p>

<p>To cut the hair of a boy or girl by force—and
apparently against their will—meant a fine of forty-five
sous. To kill a free girl before the age of
twelve cost 200 sous, after the age of twelve, here
given as the age of puberty, meant 600 sous. To
kill a woman who was <i>enceinte</i> meant a <i>wergeld</i> of
700 sous; to strike a woman who was <i>enceinte</i> was
200 sous; if the child died, 600 sous, if the woman
also died, 900 sous, and if the woman was <i>in verbo
regis</i>, under the care of the king, 1200 sous.</p>

<p>The Salic law, which was put together by four
chosen seigneurs and corrected by Clovis, Child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>bert,
and Lothair, is also interesting in that it put
a penalty on murders in such a way as to show
that even the unborn child was given a value. A
<i>wergeld</i> of 700 sous was declared against one who
killed a woman who was <i>enceinte</i>, and to kill an
unborn child entailed a <i>wergeld</i> of 200 sous.</p>

<p>The law of the Allemands, the people who have
passed away but who have left the name by which
the French designate the Germans, differed from
the Salic law in an interesting way.</p>

<p>The tendency and underlying idea of the laws
of the time is well shown in the law of the Angles
which punished the murder of a noble girl <i>non
nubile</i> with the same <i>wergeld</i> of 600 sous that it
punished the murder of a noble woman who was
no longer able to bear children. The murder of a
woman who was capable of bearing children was
punishable by a <i>wergeld</i> three times the size of
this. But the fine for a young girl or <i>non fecund</i>
woman of the plain people was only 160 sous.</p>

<p>The Burgundians in their law had no regulation
on either infanticide or abortion. The Ripurian
Francs declared strongly against both in a law
that imposed a fine of 100 sous on “any one
who killed a new-born child that had not been
named.”</p>

<p>The code of the Visigoths which was arranged
after the middle of the fifth century is the severest
of all in its penalties as to abortion and those in
any way responsible for it.</p>

<p>In the matter of exposed children the law went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
into details. Parents could not sell children, it
states, nor put them in pawn.</p>

<p>“Whoever nourished a child that had been exposed,
gained the value of a slave, which had to be
paid by the parents of the exposed child when it
was reclaimed by its parents. If the parents did
not present themselves but they should be found
out, they were forced to pay and might be sent into
exile. If they did not have the means to pay, the
one who had exposed the child became a slave in
his place to the rescuer.</p>

<p>“If a slave expose a child unknown to the master
and the master swear that he was ignorant of the
act, the person who rescues and brings up the
child can recover only one fourth of its value;
but if the exposure has been with the master’s
knowledge, the rescuer can recover the full value
of the child.”<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a></p>

<p>Those to whom a child had been given away to
bring up received an agreed price during the first
ten years of the child. After that the law declared
that the service of the child was sufficient compensation
for its nurture—an interesting sidelight
on the time when a child became amenable
to the “laws of industry.”</p>

<p>In these laws of the Visigoths it is easy to see
the influence of <i>Codex Theodosianus</i>.</p>

<p>Among the Anglo-Saxons there was a law
(<i>domas</i>) of Ina, King of Wessex, which declared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>that the nourishment for a child exposed and recovered
should be fixed at six sous for the first
year, twelve sous for the second year, and thirty
for the third. Another law of the same peoples,
ascribed to Alfred, made it necessary for
the person in charge of a foundling at the time of
its death, to establish the fact that the death had
occurred in a perfectly natural way, a sage precaution
and one centuries ahead of the time.</p>

<p>Theodoric, or Dietrich as Charles Kingsley
called him to the chagrin of Max Müller and
others, as King of the Ostrogoths made an interesting
ruling on the subject of the freedom of
children in the year 500. We learn of this through
his secretary, Cassiodorus, for, like other kings,
the Ostrogoth was wise enough to have the cleverest
literary man of his day to write his letters and
leave behind his own approved account of his
reign.</p>

<p>According to this law, when a father because
of poverty was obliged to sell his child, the child
did not therefore lose his liberty.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></p>

<p>Showing how nimble was not only the literary
talent but the spirit of Cassiodorus, it is interesting
to read in another part of the writings of the same
author a rescript sent in the name of King Athalaric,
the successor of Theodoric and his grandson,
to Severus, the governor of Lucania. As a picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
of the times that we are accustomed to think of
as dark, as well as an example of the dexterous
literary skill of Cassiodorus, the letter is worth
printing, for while it takes a most reactionary
stand on the matter of the sale of children it suggests
the epistle of Trajan to Pliny.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">King Athalaric to Severus</span>, Vir Spectabilis.</p>

<p>“We hear that the rustics are indulging in disorderly
practices, and robbing the market-people
who come down from all quarters to the chief fair
of Lucania on the day of St. Cyprian. This must
by all means be suppressed, and your Respectability
should quietly collect a sufficient number of
the owners and tenants of the adjoining farms to
overpower these freebooters and bring them to
justice. Any rustic or other person found guilty
of disturbing the fair should be at once punished
with the stick, and then exhibited with some mark
of infamy upon him.</p>

<p>“This fair, which according to the old superstition
was named Leucothea (after the nymph)
from the extreme purity of the fountain at which
it is held, is the greatest fair in all the surrounding
country. Everything that industrious Campania,
or opulent Bruittii, or cattle-breeding Calabria,
or strong Apulia produces, is there to be found exposed
for sale, on such reasonable terms that no
buyer goes away dissatisfied. It is a charming
sight to see the broad plains filled with suddenly
reared houses formed of leafy branches inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>twined:
all the beauty of the most leisurely built
city, and yet not a wall to be seen. There stand
ready boys and girls; with the attractions which
belong to their respective sexes and ages, whom not
captivity but freedom sets a price upon. These
are with good reason sold by their parents, since
they themselves gain by their servitude. For
one cannot doubt that they are benefited even as
slaves (or servants?), by being transferred from
the toil of the fields to the service of the cities.</p>

<p>“What can I say of the bright and many coloured
garments? what of the sleek well-fed cattle
offered at such a price as to tempt any purchaser?</p>

<p>“The place itself is situated in a wide and pleasant
plain, a suburb of the ancient city of Cosilinum,
and has received the name of Marcilianum
from the founder of these sacred springs.</p>

<p>“And this is in truth a marvellous fountain,
full and fresh, and of such transparent clearness
that when you look through it you think you are
looking through air alone. Choice fishes swim
about in the pool, perfectly tame, because if anyone
presumes to capture them he soon feels the
Divine vengeance. On the morning which precedes
the holy night (of St. Cyprian), as soon as
the priest begins to utter the baptismal prayer,
the water begins to rise above its accustomed
height. Generally it covers but five steps of the
well, but the brute element, as if preparing itself
for miracles, begins to swell, and at last covers two
steps more, never reached at any other time of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>year. Truly a stupendous miracle, that streams
of water should thus stand still or increase at the
sound of the human voice, as if the fountain itself
desired to listen to the sermon.</p>

<p>“Thus hath Lucania a river Jordan of her own.
Wherefore, both for religion’s sake and for the
profit of the people, it behoves that good order
should be kept among the frequenters of the fair,
since in the judgment of all, that man must be
deemed a villain who would sully the joys of such
happy days.”<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a></p>

CENTURY—SALE OF CHILDREN COMMON—STORY OF

DEBTS—DATHEUS THE FIRST TO OFFER CHILDREN

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the Eastern Empire it was always a fight
with the Church on the one hand and barbarian
customs on the other for the humanization
of the rapidly developing peoples. We may
now look at the Dark Ages in a very different
spirit from that which animated our fathers. We
now know that whatever may have been the faults
of the priests or the rulers, the world was making
progress, and new and inherently strong peoples
were developing as fast as they could assimilate
a superior civilization.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></p>

<p>The Church, very early in the history of the
Christian era, became the avowed protector of the
parentless children and it soon became a custom
to confide infants to the Church when mothers felt
that they were unable to raise their offspring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
The gain made by the Church by this step was
immeasurable, for however much those opposed to
Christianity might argue, the onward march was
irresistible when religion rested itself on the mother
instinct and, without accusation or attempted
retribution, willingly assumed the ties that maternity
was obliged to forego.</p>

<p>By the door of the churches it became the
custom to have a marble receptacle in which
mothers placed the children that they were forced
to abandon. The newly born was received by
the <i>matricularii</i> or by the priest, who, following the
form prescribed, asked those who assisted at the
adoption ceremonies if there was any known person
who would consent to take charge of the
infant. These formalities had to receive the sanction
of the bishop. Not infrequently the priest
succeeded in finding among the parishioners of
his church someone who would adopt the infant,
but if he did not, the church always assumed the
responsibility and took care of the orphan. In
some places the children that had been abandoned
by their mothers were, by the order of the bishop,
shown at the door of the church for ten days following
their abandonment, and if any one recognized
and was able to declare who the parents
were, he made such a declaration to the ecclesiastical
authorities—a dangerous custom as many
unfortunate though innocent people discovered.</p>

<p>In the case where some person not officially
connected with the church assumed the respon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>sibility
of bringing up the abandoned child, such
a person (<i>nutricarii</i>) received with the charge, a
document wherein the fact of adoption was set
forth, the circumstances under which the child
was found, and the right of the adoptive parent to
hold the child henceforth as a slave. In this connection
it must be remembered that the Code of
Justinian, which had put an end to this custom in
the East, had no force in the West. The result
was that in the European States which succeeded
to the Western Roman Empire it was an almost
general custom that abandoned children grew up
in slavery. Indeed, so general was this custom
that even the Church placed the newly born as
among its assets, the church of Seville in Spain
enumerating the number of abandoned children
taken in as among its revenues.</p>

<p>At the Council of Rouen, held in the seventh
century, the priests of each diocese were enjoined
to inform their congregations that women who
were delivered in secret might leave their infants
at the door of the church. The church thereby
attended to the immediate care of the newly born,
and while the fact that the children were brought
up in slavery was bad, it was a great improvement
over the conditions in Rome and Greece. At
least, if brought up in slavery, they were brought
up with no criminal purpose and as far as the
ecclesiastical authorities were able to regulate
their lives, they were not condemned to lives of
immorality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<p>So bad, however, were the conditions in the
seventh century, and so miserable and poor were
the people, that despite the example and the
preachings of the Church, thousands of children
were thrown on the highways or left in deserted
places to perish of starvation. Among the Gauls,
before the domination of the Franks, the heads of
families that lacked food, or the means to obtain
it, took to the market their children and sold them
as they would the veriest chattels.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> This traffic
was not only common but it took place publicly,
and not only in ancient France but in Germany,
in Flanders, in Italy, and in England. Northern
Europe was colder, more swampy, and more desolate
then than it is now and across the bleak
and uncultivated country, country such as one
finds nowhere in Europe today but on the professional
and bleak battlefields of Bulgaria and
Servia, the half-starved peasants tramped, each
with his group of children to place on sale when
the coasts of Italy or France were reached.</p>

<p>It was in this way that Saint Bathilde, afterward
the wife of King Clovis II., became the slave
of the mayor of the palace, Archambault. Bought
by the latter, she was working as a slave in his
household when the King saw her and fell in love
with her.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">406</a></p>

<p>Moved by such great misery and such odious
traffic, holy men went, purse in hand, to the places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
where these infants were being sold and purchased
the unfortunates, giving them later their liberty.
In this manner, Saint Eunice was purchased by
an Abbé du Berry and Saint Thean by Saint
Eloi.</p>

<p>The poverty led to even worse crimes than the
selling of their own children for when it was found
by the shiftless and impoverished that they could
sell their own children and the foundlings that
they picked up, not infrequently they robbed
more fortunate parents of children that were being
well taken care of.</p>

<p>Similar distress and want had led to similar
conditions in the fifth century. In 449 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>, the
times were so hard and the people were in such a
famished condition in Italy and Gaul that parents
sold their children to middlemen even though
they knew the children were to be resold to the
Vandals in Africa. Two years later Valentinian
broke up this practice, declaring that the person
who sold a free person for the purpose of having
that person sold to the barbarians would be fined
six ounces of gold.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></p>

<p>This traffic was carried to such an excess in the
British Islands that it became the principal object
of an apostolic mission of Gregory who became
Pope in 590.</p>

<p>“Our Divine Redeemer,” he wrote, “has delivered
us from all servitude and has given unto us
our original liberty. Let us imitate his example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
by freeing from slavery those men who are free
by the laws of nature.”</p>

<p>The attitude toward children in England under
the Anglo-Saxon kings<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> is shown by the fact that
a boy’s accountability, his capability of bearing
arms and of the management of his property began,
according to the earlier laws, in his tenth, but
according to the laws of Æthelstan, in his twelfth
year.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> “The accountability of children was extended
even to the infant in the cradle, whereby,
in the case of theft committed by the father, they,
like those of mature age, were consigned to slavery,
but this cruel practice was by a law of Cnut
strictly forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> This premature majority of
the Anglo-Saxon youth accounts for the early
accession to the throne of some of the kings, as
Edward the Martyr, who was crowned in his
thirteenth year. Majority at the age of ten is
not mentioned in any other Germanic laws, excepting
in favour of the young testator, or the
son whose father could not or would not support
him. The beginning of the thirteenth year as
that of majority is strictly and universally Germanic.”<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">411</a></p>

<p>“The doctrines of the Church,” say Terme and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
Monfalcon, “were indeed admirable—they breathed
the purest, the finest morality and the most ardent
love of humanity, but they were unable to prevail
against the ignorance of the people and the barbarity
of their morals.”</p>

<p>Coming to the first attempts at organized effort
to save children by the Church we find that Article
70 of the Council of Nicaea instructed the bishop
to establish in each city a place to which travellers,
the sick and the poor, might appeal for aid and
shelter. The <i>Xenodocheion</i>, as it was called, is
to this day the word for “hotel” in modern
Greece, where the traveller in Europe will conclude
there is little evidence of improvement since the
ecclesiastical foundation. These places were also
used as the asylums for children, a fact that led
them to be called <i>Brephotrophia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></p>

<p>In the West a similar movement sprang up, and
in the life of Saint Gour, contemporary of Childebert,
it is said that at Trèves there was something
like a systematic endeavour to protect children.
A great obscurity hangs around this foundation,
and it is equally difficult to determine positively
what is the exact character of the institution
ascribed to Saint Marmbœuf, who died in Angers
in 654.</p>

<p>Of the efforts of Datheus, however, there are
no doubts, though interesting is the fact that no
biographical encyclopædia contains even his name.
He was Archbishop of Milan, and the first insti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>tution
to take care of helpless children was founded
by him in 787.</p>

<p>“An enervating and sensual life,” declared
Datheus in founding the asylum, “leads many
astray. They commit adultery and do not dare
show the fruits in public and therefore put them
to death. By depriving the children of baptism
they send them to hell. These horrors would not
take place if there existed an asylum where the
adulterer could hide her shame, but now they
throw the infants in the sewers or the rivers and
many are the murders committed on the new-born
children as the result of this illicit intercourse.</p>

<p>“Therefore, I, Datheus, for the welfare of my
soul and the souls of my associates, do hereby
establish in the house that I have bought next to
the church, a hospital for foundling children. My
wish is that as soon as a child is exposed at the
door of a church that it will be received in the
hospital and confided to the care of those who will
be paid to look after them.... These infants
will be taught a trade and my wish is that when
they arrive at the age of eight years they will be
free from the shackles of slavery and free to come
or go wherever they will.”<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">413</a></p>

<p>In 1380 a similar institution was opened in Venice,
and in Florence in 1421. There is no doubt that
similar institutions were most frequent in the
fifteenth century. Pontanus, a writer of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
age, speaks of having seen nine hundred children
in the one at Naples, and openly expresses his admiration
for the liberal education that they received
and the care bestowed on them by their
teachers.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">414</a></p>

<p>The most purely religious institute appears to
have been, according to the able Gaillard, that
of the Bourgognes<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> in imitation of the charity of
St. Marthe in her house in Bethany. An order,
that of the <i>chanoines réguliers du Saint Esprit</i>, was
founded, or at least encouraged by Guy of Montpellier
about the end of the twelfth century for
the express purpose of caring for poor and abandoned
children. The same institution is also
said to have had for its founder, Olivier de la
Crau in 1010. In any case it was not until 1188,
eight years after the foundation of the order
ascribed to Guy of Montpellier, that the hospital
of Marseilles was established.</p>

<p>The historians of Languedoc<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> do not justify
the assumption that this same Guy was the son
of the Count of Montpellier, and all that we know
is that “Brother Guy” or “Master Guy,” as he
was differently called,<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> apparently founded an
asylum for sick men and abandoned children.</p>

<p>The success of this order was immediate. In
1197, Bernard de Montlaur and his wife left a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
substantial donation to the Hospital of Saint
Esprit at Montpellier, and to Guy, its founder.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">418</a>
Public approval was followed by official approval,
for the Senate of Marseilles, or the Honourable
Council, as it was called, held its meetings in the
hospital founded there by Guy in 1188 and began
its deliberations always with a discussion about
the condition of the poor.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">419</a></p>

<p>Following the efforts of Guy of Montpellier,
at Montpellier and at Marseilles, the movement,
under the auspices of the <i>hospitaliers</i> of Saint
Esprit, spread so rapidly that before the end of the
century there were institutions at Rome,<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> one at
Bergliac, and one at Troyes, and others in different
places.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> The order founded by Guy was given the
approval of the Holy See, and its founder was
called to Rome by Innocent III. and placed in
charge of the house of Santa Maria in Sassia,
where the Pope wished the same spirit that had
marked Guy’s own institution at Montpellier.
Guy died in Rome, 1208.</p>

<div class="caption">FILLING CHRISTMAS BASKETS FOR POOR CHILDREN—MOTHERS’ HELPING HAND CLUB, NEW YORK CITY</div>
</div>

<p>The house of Santa Maria in Sassia to which
Guy was called was attached to the church of that
name which had been founded by Gna, king of the
later Saxons, in 715. It had undergone many
disastrous changes, but in 1198 Innocent III., at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>his own expense, had it renovated and repaired
for the sick and poor of Rome. In 1204, moved
by the frequency with which the fishermen of the
Tiber found in their nets the bodies of children
that had been thrown into the river, the Pope
dedicated part of the hospital to the care of abandoned
children, and it was to this institution that
Guy of Montpellier was called.</p>

<p>The humane movement spread rapidly, generally
under at least the nominal guidance of the
Order of Saint Esprit. Many institutions, however,
were founded in the name of Saint Esprit
where little attention was paid to children.</p>

<p>The institution at Embeck<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> founded in 1274
made a special work of taking care of abandoned
children in the name of Saint Esprit. We come
now to the name of Enrad Fleinz,<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> that bourgeois
of Nuremberg, who in 1331 founded in his natal
town the first hospital where not only children
might be left, but where women might go to be
delivered, without regard to whether the offspring
were legitimate or not. This, too, was in the name
of Saint Esprit, and in the year 1362, a similar
asylum for orphans was founded in Paris.</p>

<p>It was indeed under the auspices of this order
that the movement which began with the imperial
<i>Brephotrophia</i> in the sixth century grew, until
the various institutions of one sort or another
intended to prevent the outright murder of child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>ren
or their abandonment in deserted places were
dependent, not on the humanity of any one man
or group of men, but on the new-born spirit that
was then spreading throughout Europe and that
continued to spread even when individualism and
materialism as ruling forces had supplanted religion
and asceticism. The history of charity,
which, as Lecky says, is yet to be written, will
doubtless reveal, when it comes to be written, the
various unappreciated factors that went to produce
the humane movement.</p>

<p>Some idea of how rapidly these institutions had
multiplied may be obtained from a bull of Nicholas
IV., containing a long enumeration of the various
foundations, which includes places in Italy,
Sicily, Germany, England, France, and Spain.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">424</a></p>

<p>Besides those enumerated by the Pope, there
were however other institutions springing up
where, either as an adjunct to hospital work or as
an independent work itself, children were being
cared for. As one of the original and most scholarly
writers on this phase of the subject has pointed
out, it is difficult to make positive statements
about these foundations, for the men interested
were intent on their work rather than on leaving
a record of it behind. Perhaps in this connection,
some future historian, in viewing the voluminous
charitable records of our day, will assume that
“social” egotism has been well saddled, and made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>to do more than the work of a timely charitable
impulse.</p>

<div class="caption">SAINT VINCENT DE PAUL, FOUNDER OF THE FIRST PERMANENT ASYLUM
FOR CHILDREN IN FRANCE</div>
</div>

<p>The conditions that led to the crusade of
Vincent of Paul antedated that philanthropist
by several hundred years. Where the religious
spirit had failed to arouse interest in the problem
of the welfare of parentless children, the large
cities of Europe were themselves forced to take
some action. Milan, in 1168, on the prayer of the
Cardinal Galdinus, founded a hospital (which
would indicate that the institution founded by
Datheus had either fallen into disuse or was inadequate)
and Venice in 1380 followed the example
of Milan, while the magnificent hospital for foundling
children in Florence (Spidale degl’ Innocenti)
was founded, after a long deliberation in open
council, on October 25, 1421.</p>

<p>Included in these governmental or municipal
movements is that of St. Thomas of Villeneuve,
Archbishop of Valence, who created an asylum in
his own palace at the beginning of the fifteenth
century, and gave orders that no children presented
there should be turned away.</p>

<p>The Hotel-Dieu de Notre Dame de Pitié of
Lyons, which by letters patent of 1720 was declared
to be the oldest hospital of France, commenced
in 1523 the same work, and in that year
is recorded as having received nine children. On
February 25, 1530, François the First recognized
the right of the institution to take in these
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p>In 1596 the city of Amsterdam began to make
provision for the abandoned children.</p>

<p>The beginning of the movement in Paris, we
learn, was the result of the terrible conditions
that followed the war in 1360, 1361, and 1362.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">425</a>
Poverty and misery were everywhere, and a large
number of orphans practically lived and died in
the streets, says Breuil in his <i>Antiquités de Paris</i>.
Various charitable people took in some of these
unfortunates, the Hotel-Dieu being overrun; but,
as the conditions were but little ameliorated, on
February 7, 1362, a group of citizens went to the
“Reverend father in God, Messire Jean de Meulant,
88th Bishop of Paris,” and discussed with
him the frightful conditions of the poor boys and
girls of Paris. The evils attending the homeless
condition of the latter were especially considered.
We are told that the result of the conference was
that the Bishop gave them permission to institute
and erect a hospital of Saint Esprit and bestowed
on each one of the conferees forty days’ indulgence.</p>

<p>The institution that arose as a result of this
conference has been criticized as being narrow in
its purpose, inasmuch as the rules declared that
only legitimate children, born of parents in Paris,
were to be admitted; but the restriction, it must
be understood, was necessary, in view of the small
funds in hand.</p>

<p>But humanitarian feeling was growing; and
people were beginning to be proud of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
thoughtful and kind. It was no longer a mark of
superiority to be lustful of blood. Botterays, in a
Latin poem on Paris,<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> spoke of the splendid way
in which the orphan children of Paris were brought
up, referring to the Hospital of Saint Esprit and
the House of the Enfants-Dieu. After long
years of nominal acquiescence in its teachings,
the barbarians of the North were really beginning
to accept the Christianity of Christ.</p>

<p>CRUELTY TO CHILDREN IN THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH

CHILDREN FOR MOUNTEBANK PURPOSES—ANECDOTE
OF VINCENT DE PAUL—HIS
WORK AND HIS SUCCESS.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>ROM Datheus to Vincent de Paul the general
history of the child in Europe moves as
from one mountain peak to another with
a long valley of gloom in between. Datheus has
received no credit; Vincent de Paul has been justly
recognized as a deserving contemporary of that
list of brilliant men who went to make up the
Golden Age of France. Golden Age that it was,
with its highly polished manners, there, under the
reign of the elegant Mazarin and the delicate Anne
of Austria, it was no uncommon sight to see a
child lying dead on the pavements, while others
died of misery and hunger under the very eyes of
the passers-by. Not a day passed, say the chroniclers,
when the men who had charge of the sewers
or the police did not draw out at least the body
of one child.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the seventeenth century
Europe, and France especially, was war-ridden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
During the sixteenth century, the religious and
charitable impulses had suffered, first through the
national war, then by the factional wars, and
finally by religious wars.</p>

<p>“The religious war,” said the historian of Languedoc,<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a>
“almost entirely destroyed the Hospital
of Montpellier ... and even the order of Saint
Esprit was dying out throughout France.”</p>

<p>It was a curious and disjointed society, that of
the France of that day. Kingdoms there were
within the royal domain; the laws of the large city
frequently clashing with those of the province
within which it was located; here and there provinces
following their own laws rather than the
laws of the kingdom itself. In some provinces
the Church dominated; in others the nobles; elsewhere,
the two classes were beginning to melt into
the body of the nation which occasionally overrode
both.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">428</a></p>

<p>At Aix, for instance, it was the custom to place
the abandoned child in a religious home where,
as in the rest of Provence, the unknown bastard
was charged to the nearest hospital. Practically
the same law was observed in Bretagne.</p>

<p>At Poitiers, a decree on September 15, 1579,
“condemning the provision by which religious
orders nourished infants found at their door,”
ordered that the monasteries and ecclesiastic chapters
of the place should be called on to regu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>late
their contributions to the support of the
children.</p>

<p>But as a rule the great nobles were obliged to
take care of the foundlings abandoned within their
jurisdiction. In the origin of the fiefs, the bastards
had been set down as <i>épaves</i> (waifs), and the
interpreters of the law (<i>jurisconsults</i>) had decided
that the lord had no right to refuse to take care
of the <i>épaves</i>. The parliaments too took the view
that, inasmuch as the <i>seigneur</i> profited by all
deaths that occurred and succeeded to all titles
in the case of disinheritance within his domain,
he should accept the liability for the care of the
unknown children found within their domain.</p>

<p>Of the many decrees which touch on this important
point, the oldest is that of the Parliament
of Paris in the year 1547. Many other <i>arrêts</i>
followed, until on September 3, 1667, the following,
in the interest of the special hospitals, declared
that:</p>

<p>“All the <i>seigneurs</i> (<i>hauts justiciers</i>) will be held
responsible for the expense and nourishment of
all infants whose parents are unknown, and who
are found exposed on their lands and taken to
hospitals.”</p>

<p>This regulation, as Ramcle says, failed in its
purpose, for it was not possible to force what was
considered charity on the none too generous nobles.
The laws were evaded, and each community tried
to send to its neighbours the unfortunate infants
it should have guarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span></p>

<p>The mortality of infants increased, and as in
Rome in the days of the Empire, mothers threw
their children into the sewers or left them on the
highways. Those less inhuman left them at the
doors of the hospitals, where, during the winter,
in the morning, they were frequently taken in
more dead than alive.</p>

<p>Of course, the laws against these abandonments
were promptly enforced—the unfortunate women
were easily punished. A girl who killed her offspring
was hung, and others who were caught leaving
children in solitary places were whipped and
disgraced in the cities and villages where they lived.</p>

<p>By an edict of Henry II., under penalty of
punishment, a woman <i>enceinte</i> was obliged to declare
her condition; and to add to this bungling
legislative effort, she was obliged to tell who the
guilty man was, the maxim <i>creditur virgini</i> being
accepted everywhere. The attempts at curing the
ills failed, for, while the intentions of the legislators
were undoubtedly honest, they only exposed
shameless conditions, made the unfortunate suffer
even more, brought ruin to many honest families,
and gain to shameless women only. The number
of children abandoned and murdered in defiance
of the regulations increased instead of decreasing.</p>

<p>At this time there came an individual effort to
better things, by a woman whose name is not even
known and whose efforts at a noble work have,
owing to the actions of her servants, been much
misinterpreted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p>Living in a house in the Cité de Saint-Landry,
Paris, with two servants, she received every morning
the infants that the soldiers (or police) had
collected during the night. So many were eventually
turned over to her, that she was unable to
feed them, and many died in her own house for
lack of food. In the crowded conditions we are
also told a selection<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> was made and some of the
children were exposed again, or at least they were
turned over to some charitable or interested person
who would accept them. The care of the
children devolving finally on the two servants,
many of them are said to have perished from
the drugs they were given to keep them quiet.
The availability of children as beggars led the
servants to look on them as a means of money
making, and they were sold for various cruel and
evil purposes, a condition that eventually led to
the reform undertaken by Vincent de Paul.</p>

<p>The fact that they frequently fell into the hands
of magicians, mountebanks, and pedlars, who
deformed them in order to make them of assistance
in earning a livelihood, is attested by the biographer
of Vincent.</p>

<p>“Returning from one of his missions,” says
Maury, “Vincent de Paul, whom I have dared to
call almost the visible angel of God, found under
the walls of Paris one of these infants, in the hands
of a beggar, who was engaged in deforming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
limbs of the child. Although almost overcome
with horror, he ran to the savage with that intrepidity
with which the virtuous man always attacks
crime.</p>

<p>“‘Barbarian,’ he cried, ‘how you deceive me—from
a distance I took you for a man!’</p>

<p>“He snatched the victim from its persecutor,
carried it in his arms across Paris, gathered a
crowd about him and called on them to witness
the brutality of the day and place in which they
lived. A few days later he had founded his first
institution for children, and the cause of children
had enrolled one of its noblest champions.”</p>

<p>In order to thoroughly understand the situation,
a number of charitable women under the guidance
of Madame Legas, niece of the Lord Chancellor
Marillac,<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> went to the house in the Cité de Saint-Landry
and studied the question from the inside
of the house. Their horror at the things they
saw led them to declare that the children massacred
by Herod were fortunate in comparison
with the condition of the orphans of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> As
it was impossible to take charge of all the children
then in the Cité de Saint-Landry twelve children
were taken, and in 1638, under the care of Madame
Legas and some charitable women, a house was
opened for them in the Faubourg Saint-Victor.
As they were able to enlarge the scope of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
institution, more and more children were taken
care of; the enthusiasm of these women ran so
high under the glowing example of Vincent,
that even in the dead of night in the cold corners,
they would be found going about the streets of
Paris, into the worst and least lighted sections,
doing police duty, gathering the unfortunate
victims, and carrying them to the house in the
Faubourg Saint-Victor.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></p>

<p>In the course of time, sufficient interest had
developed in this work so that enough money was
forthcoming to enlarge the scope. Vincent gathered
together the pious women who had acted as
his assistants and addressed to them that <i>touchante
allocution</i>, sometimes quoted as a model of
eloquence.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> The house in the Faubourg Saint-Victor
was soon found to be too small, and
the Château de Bicêtre was obtained from the
king.</p>

<p>The place was not found suitable on account of
the <i>vivacité de l’air</i> and the children were transferred
to the Faubourg Saint-Lazare, then in
1672 to the Cité, near Notre Dame, where they
remained up to the Revolution. Then they were
assigned the ancient <i>abbaye</i> of Port Royal and the
<i>maison de l’Oratoire</i>, located in the southern part
of Paris.</p>

<p>The success of the new undertaking was so
great that even Louis XIII. became interested and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
donated four thousand francs per year to the charity.
Inasmuch as in the long history of the child’s
fight for a place in the government, this was the
first recognition by a government since the Roman
emperors, it is interesting to read Louis’s own
statement in the preamble of the letters patent
relating to this gift:</p>

<p>“Having been informed by persons of great
piety, that the little attention which has been
given up to the present to the nourishing and care
of the parentless children exposed in the city and
outskirts of Paris has been the cause of death,
and even has it been known that they have been
sold for evil purposes, and this having brought
many ladies to take care of these children, who
have worked with so much zeal and charitable
affection that their zeal is spreading, and wishing
so much to do what is possible under the present
circumstances,<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> we have,” etc.</p>

<p>The example of Louis was followed in 1641 by
his widow, Anne of Austria, who made an annual
gift of 8000 francs. She had become regent and,
speaking in the name of the young King, said that
“imitating the piety and the charity of the late
King, which are truly royal virtues, he adds to this
first gift, another annual gift of 8000 francs.
Thanks to what has already been given and the
charity of individuals, the greater number of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
infants rescued have been raised, and there are
now more than four hundred living.”</p>

<p>In June, 1670, Louis XIV. made the children’s
hospital one of the institutions of Paris, and
authorized it to discharge the functions and enjoy
the privileges of such an institution.</p>

<p>“As there is no duty more natural,” he declared,
“and none that conforms more to the idea of
Christian charity than to care for the unfortunate
children who are exposed—their feebleness and
their misfortune making them doubly worthy of
our compassion ... considering also that their
protection and safeguarding is to our advantage
inasmuch as some of them may become soldiers,
others workmen, inhabitants of the colonies,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">435</a></p>

<p>The edict declared that while the expenses of
the institution had reached forty thousand francs
a year, the royal donation could not exceed twelve
thousand francs, and the King exhorted the
women of charity who had done so much, to continue
their notable work.</p>

<p>This royal recognition of the great institution
at Paris was not without evil effect in the provinces.
The nobles and the civic authorities of
rural communities, wishing to get rid of the burden
of the infants deserted within their jurisdiction,
had the unfortunates taken to Paris.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> They were
usually carried there by men who were driving
in on other business, and as many stops were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
made between the starting point and the destination,
and as the drivers were more interested in
other things than in the infant baggage, for which
they were paid in advance, the mortality greatly
increased.</p>

<p>“There was hardly a town in the kingdom,”
said Latyone,<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> “where abandoned children were
admitted freely and without information being
requested. In the towns that were not too far
from Paris, they were carried thirty and forty
leagues, at the risk of having them die on the
way; and the hospital at Paris was overcrowded
and in debt.”</p>

<p>This condition of affairs led to a new law, after
a report which declared that of two thousand infants
carried to Paris from the provinces, in all
sorts of weather, by public vehicles without care or
protection, three quarters had died within three
months. The new law decreed that any wagoner
bringing an infant to Paris to expose it would be
fined one thousand livres. Inasmuch as the rule
was made in the interest of the children, it was
also decreed that abandoned children must be
brought to the nearest hospital, and if that hospital
declared that it had not enough funds to support
the foundlings, the royal treasury might be
drawn on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>RISE OF FACTORY SYSTEM—THE CHILD A CHARGE ON
THE STATE—CHILDREN ACTUALLY SLAVES UNDER
FACTORY SYSTEM—REFORM OF 1833—OASTLER
AGAINST THE CHILD SLAVERY—“JUVENILE LABOUR
IN FACTORIES IS A NATIONAL BLESSING”.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE cannibalistic stage has passed and the
day of sacrifice has passed—no longer is
the child frankly a convenience nor is its
life, as a result of past economic stress, a lightly
considered trifle to be tossed into the cauldron of
religious ceremony. Philosophy, humanity, civilization,
and religion have combined to make the
life of the child safe.</p>

<p>With what result?</p>

<p>The general belief that children were not regularly
employed until the middle of the last century,
when the factory system arose, had led to the
equally erroneous belief that it was in the factory
where the industrial abuse of children was first
practised. In France where there was little industrial
use for children in the large centres of
population, where in other words children did not
pay, the problem of modern humanity was to
save infants from exposure and death. In Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>land
where there was an industrial use for them
from early times, and where from the earliest
times there are records of their abuse, there was
no necessity for measures to protect them from
infanticidal tendencies. But it is in England
that we must study the ill-treatment of children
that was brought about by the desire to make
them useful.</p>

<p>The industrial records of the Middle Ages contain
but few references<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> to children, for the adults
were busy with their own troubles. One of the
first of these notices was an order issued by the
famous Richard Whittington, in 1398, and, although
it is mixed with other considerations, it
shows the human spark. It reads:</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Ordinances of the Hurers.</span></p>

<p class="center">“<i>22 Richard II., <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1398. Letter-Book H., fol.
cccxviii. (Norman French).</i></p>

<p>“On the 20th day of August, in the 22d year,
etc., the following Articles of the trade of Hurers
were by Richard Whityngtone, Mayor, and the
Aldermen, ordered to be entered.—</p>

<p>“In the first place,—that no one of the said
trade shall scour a <i>cappe</i> or <i>hure</i>, or anything pertaining
to <i>scouryng</i>, belonging to the said trade,
in any open place: but they must do this in their
own houses; seeing that some persons in the said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>trade have of late sent their apprentices and
journeymen as well as children of tender age and
others, down to the water of Thames and other
exposed places, and amid horrible tempests,
frosts, and snows, to the very great scandal, as
well of the good folks of the said trade, as of the
City aforesaid. And also, because of that divers
persons, and pages belonging to lords, when they
take their horses down to the Thames, are often-times
wrangling with their said apprentices and
journeymen; and they are then on the point of
killing one another, to the very great peril that
seems likely to ensue therefrom.”<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">439</a></p>

<p>In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, when
the peasants were the villeins of the owners of the
land and held their small farms in return for the
work done, the work of children was contracted
for, “the lord very frequently demanding the
labour of the whole family, with the exception of
the housewife.”<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">440</a></p>

<p>Nearly all the trades and manufactures in the
Middle Ages were under the control of the guilds,
so that almost all of the children working, excepting
those on farms or in domestic service, came
under their supervision. The attitude of the
guilds toward child labour is shown in the regulations
of the apprenticeships, but this interest was
mainly industrial, for in regulating the work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
the children they protected their members from
cheap labour and at the same time, by their supervision
over the work of the rising generation, saw
that the guild’s reputation for the proper kind of
labour was kept up and prices therefore held to a
desirable level.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">441</a></p>

<p>At the same time there was a religious side to the
guilds, a strong religious side, and while everything
they did, such as the prohibition of night work
(not out of consideration of the health of the workers
but because it might lead to bad work),<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> had a
purely industrial aspect, there is no doubt that
this social and religious side developed in the guilds
and their members an outlook on the broader
and more humane aspects of their own place in
society. The custom of not permitting a man to
employ other than his own wedded wife and his
own daughter was not humanitarian in its intention
but its effect could not be other than beneficial.</p>

<p>“No one of the said trade,” said the ordinances
of the Braelers (makers of braces) in 1355, “shall
be so daring as to work at his trade at night ...
also, that no one of the said trade shall be so
daring as to set any woman to work in his trade,
other than his wedded wife, or his daughter.”<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></p>

<p>In 1562 the Statute of Artificers was passed,
regulating the system of apprenticeship which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
hitherto been a matter of regulation only among
the guilds themselves. The national sanction
thereby given to the apprentice system meant
much and had a great influence in the years to
come. The chief features of the Act, binding by
indenture, registration of the agreement, and a
minimum term of seven years on the indoor system,
led to the master’s entire control of the boy and
up to 1814 affected the relationships of the child
employed or otherwise under the control of an
employer.</p>

<p>Coincident with the development of the interest
in the child as an industrial factor arose the interest
in the child as a charge on the State, a phase
of the child question that in the ancient civilizations
had found its answer mainly in the toleration
of infanticide. The Common Council of London
on September 27, 1556, passed an Act, the following
extract from which will go to show that there
was then an attempt to go back of the child
problem and an endeavour to regulate marriage.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Forasmuche as</span> great pouertie, penurye

<p>In the time of Henry VIII. an attempt was
made to take care of the question of the growing
number of vagrant children by making all vagrant
children between the years of five and fourteen
liable to be bound out to some master as apprentices,
the boys until they were twenty-four and
the girls until they were twenty.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">445</a></p>

<p>In 1601 a statute was passed which gave to
justices of the peace the power of apprenticing
not only the children of paupers and vagrants
but the children of those parents who were overburdened
with children and who were unable to
support them.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">And</span> be it further enacted that it shalbe lawfull
for the saide churchwardens and overseers, or the
greater parte of them, by the assent of any two
justices of the peace aforesaid, to binde any suche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
children as aforesaide to be apprentices, where
they shall see convenient, till suche man child

and such woman child to the age of one and twenty
yeares, or the tyme of her mariage; the same to be

hym or her selfe.”<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">446</a></p>

<p>In the seventeenth century, the practice of
putting children prematurely to work prevailed
to an extent which, when compared with the extent
of the manufacturing system, “seems almost
incredible,” says Macaulay.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">447</a></p>

<p>A little creature of six years old was thought fit
for labour in the town of Norwich, the chief seat
of the clothing trade. Writers at that time, and
among them some who were considered as eminently
benevolent,<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> mention, “with exultation, the
fact that in that single city boys and girls of tender
age created wealth exceeding what was necessary
for their own subsistence by twelve thousand
pounds a year.”</p>

<p>The industrial revolution of the eighteenth
century was sudden and violent. All the great
inventions of Watt, Arkwright, and Boulton were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>made within twenty years, steam was applied to
the new looms, and the modern factory system
had fairly begun.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> With the demand for labourers
and the fact that the division of labour brought
about a call for low-priced workmen, some of the
divisions really necessitating no greater intelligence
than that of a child, the children were in
great demand.</p>

<p>It was here that the Statute of Artificers assisted
in the crushing industrial conditions, for
the overseers of the poor became the agents of
the mill-owners and arranged for days when the
pauper children could be inspected and selected
for the factory work. When the selections had
been made, the children were conveyed by canal
boats and wagons to the destination, and then
their slavery began. Sometimes men who made
a business of trafficking in children would transfer
them to a factory district where they were kept
in a dark cellar until the mill-owner, in want of
hands, came to look them over and pick out those
that he thought would be useful. Nominally
the children were apprentices, but actually they
were slaves and their treatment was most inhuman.
The parish authorities, in order to get rid of the
imbeciles, often bargained that the mill-owners
take one idiot with every twenty children. What
became of the idiots after they had passed into
the hands of the capitalist is not known, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
most cases they did not last long and mysteriously
disappeared.</p>

<p>No matter what the conditions and no matter
how ill the children, they were worked without
any visible vestige of human feeling. Even as
late as 1840 in the evidence given before the Select
Committee investigating the conditions of factories
after the passage of the Reform Act of 1833,
these were the conditions that the inspectors
reported:</p>

<p>Q. “Have you many lace-mills in your district?”</p>

<p>A. “I have about thirty mills.”</p>

<p>Q. “What are the usual hours of work in these
mills?”</p>

<p>A. “The usual hours are, about Nottingham,
<i>twenty hours a day</i>, being from four o’clock in the
morning till twelve o’clock at night; about Chesterfield,
the report I have had from the superintendent
is, that they work twenty-four hours, all through
the night, in several mills there.”</p>

<p>Q. “Are there many children and young persons
in those mills?”</p>

<p>A. “The proportion is less in lace-mills than
in others, but it is necessary to have some of
them; the process of winding and preparing the
bobbins and carriages requires children; those
that I saw so employed were <i>from ten to fifteen
years of age</i>.”</p>

<p>Q. “Are the children detained in the mills
during a considerable period of the day and night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span></p>

<p>A. “I can speak from information derived
from two or three mill-owners, and also more
extensively from reports by one of the superintendents
in my district; and I should say that in
most of the mills they do detain them at night;
in some of them, the report states that they are
detained all night, in order to be ready when
wanted.”</p>

<p>Q. “Are the children that are so detained
liable to be detained throughout the day, and do
they sometimes begin their work at twelve o’clock
at night?”</p>

<p>A. “In the mills at Nottingham there are
owners that make it a rule that they will not keep
the children after eight, or nine, or ten o’clock,
according to the inclination of the mill-occupier.”</p>

<p>Q. “Where are those children during the time
they are detained in the mill?”</p>

<p>A. “<i>When detained at night, and not employed
I am told they are lying about on the floor.</i>”</p>

<p>Q. “Is it customary to close at eight on Saturday
evening in the lace-mills?”</p>

<p>A. “I think it is.”</p>

<p>Q. “How then do they compensate for the
loss of those four hours work in those mills?”</p>

<p>A. “<i>By working all night on Friday</i>; those
are the mills in which they pay so much for their
power.”</p>

<p>Q. “Must not there be a considerable wear and
tear upon the physical constitution of children
who are kept in this state?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span></p>

<p>A. “I think it is self-evident.”</p>

<p>Q. “Is there any possibility of their obtaining
education under those circumstances?”</p>

<p>A. “None whatever, except on Sundays.”</p>

<p>Q. “But, after one hundred and twenty hours’
work in the week, is it possible that they can
have much capacity for study on Sunday?”</p>

<p>A. “It is not always that the same children
are kept twenty hours, because some mills have
two complete sets of hands for their machinery,
and they work the same set of hands only ten
hours.”</p>

<p>Q. “But, even under those circumstances, it
must frequently happen that the same children
are employed during the night twice or thrice in
the course of a week?”</p>

<p>A. “The practice generally is that they take
the night-work for one week, and then the next
week the morning-work.”</p>

<p>Q. “So that during one whole week they are
employed in the night-work?”</p>

<p>A. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Q. “At the end of a week, during which they
have been employed in the night, do you think
that they have much capacity left for study on
Sunday?”</p>

<p>A. “No; my opinion is most decidedly that
either turning out at four o’clock in the morning,
or being kept out of bed at night, must be injurious
to children, both to their physical constitution
and their mental powers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p>Q. “The law, as it stands, does not prevent
the children from being employed even twenty
hours?”</p>

<p>A. “It does not apply to lace-mills.”</p>

<p>Q. “Therefore the period during which the
child is employed depends upon the varying
humanity of the individual proprietor of the mill?”</p>

<p>A. “Yes.”</p>

<p>Q. “You say that it sometimes happens that
the children come to the mill at five in the morning,
and do not leave it till ten at night?”</p>

<p>A. “It is reported to me that it does so happen
about Chesterfield.”</p>

<p>Q. “If a child is kept in winter till twelve
o’clock at night, and has then to go home and
return to the factory in the morning, a distance
of two miles, does not he undergo fearful hardships?”</p>

<p>A. “Certainly.”<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">450</a></p>

<p>The children who were apprenticed out to the
mill-owners were fed on the coarsest kind of food
and in the most disgusting way. They slept by
turns, in relays, in beds that were never aired,
for one set of children were turned into the beds
as soon as another set had been driven out to their
long and filthy toil. Some tried to run away and
after that they were worked with chains around
their ankles; many died and the little graves were
unmarked in a desolate spot lest the number of
the dead attract too much attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>

<p>Sixteen hours a day, six days a week, was no
uncommon time for children, and on Sunday they
worked to clean the machine.</p>

<p>“In stench, in heated rooms, amid the constant
whirling of a thousand wheels, little fingers and
little feet were kept in ceaseless action, forced
into unnatural activity by blows from the heavy
hands and feet of the merciless overlooker, and
the infliction of bodily pain by instruments of
punishment, invented by the sharpened ingenuity
of insatiable selfishness.”<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">451</a></p>

<p>The agitation against these conditions led, in
1802, to an Act being passed by the influence of
Sir Robert Peel for the preservation of the health
and morals of apprentices and others employed
in cotton and other mills.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of this was the fearful
spread through the factories in the Manchester
district of epidemic diseases due to overwork,
scanty food, wretched clothing, long hours, bad
ventilation, among the working people and especially
among the children.</p>

<p>As far as reforming the conditions in which the
children lived, the Act, however, was a dead letter,
and in a debate introduced by Sir Robert Peel
on June 6, 1815, one speaker, Horner, told of the
sale of a gang of children with the effects of a
bankrupt.</p>

<p>“A still more atrocious instance,” continued
the speaker, “had been brought before the Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
of King’s Bench two years ago, when a number of
these boys apprenticed by a parish in London to
one manufacturer had been transferred (<i>i. e.</i>,
sold) to another and had been found by some
benevolent persons in a state of absolute famine.”<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">452</a></p>

<p>No longer could people ignore conditions such
as these and a Select Committee of the House of
Commons was empowered to take evidence on
the state of children working in the manufactories
of Great Britain. Despite the horrible nature of
the evidence, when the Act resulting from the
investigation was passed, all that it did was to
make nine years the limit to age employment and
twelve hours a day the working day for those
under sixteen years. But it was limited in effect
to cotton factories only, leaving the woollen and
worsted factories absolutely untouched, and even
in the matter of the cotton factories these provisions
were frequently avoided.</p>

<p>Conditions continued to become worse instead
of better, children of both sexes being beaten and
overworked to make profit for the rich capitalists
until 1830, when Richard Oastler, who had led
in the fight against black slavery, had his attention
called to the conditions under which the
children of England were practically enslaved.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></p>

<p>Oastler was talking one night about his slavery
reforms to a friend near Bradford and the remark
was made to him: “I wonder you never turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
your attention to the factory.” “Why should I?”
replied the young abolitionist, “I have nothing
to do with factories.” “Perhaps not,” was the
answer, “but you are very enthusiastic against
slavery in the West Indies and I assure you that
there are cruelties practised in our mills on little
children which I am sure if you knew you would
try to prevent.”</p>

<p>The man who gave this suggestion, John Wood,
was himself an owner of a mill and he admitted
to Oastler that in his own mill the little children
were worked from six in the morning until seven
at night with a break of only forty minutes for
lunch and that various devices, including beatings
with sticks and straps and clubs, were employed
to goad them on to renewed labour.</p>

<p>The very next day Oastler began a crusade
which lasted for many weary years. He succeeded
in interesting J. Hobhouse and M. T. Sadler,
both members of the House of Commons, and the
ten hours agitation began in and out of Parliament.
In the course of a speech delivered in
March, 1832, in favour of the ten hours bill, Sadler
declared that so great was the demand in some
districts for children’s labour that “an indispensable
condition of marriage among the working
classes was the certainty of offspring whose wages,
beginning at six years old, might keep their inhuman
fathers and mothers in idleness.”</p>

<p>“Our ancestors could not have supposed it
possible,” exclaimed Sadler, “posterity will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
believe it true—that a generation of Englishmen
could exist, or had existed, that would work lisping
infancy a few summers old, regardless alike
of its smiles or tears, and unmoved by its unresisting
weakness, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen
hours a day, and through the weary night also,
till in the dewy morn of existence, the bud of
youth was faded and fell ere it was unfolded.”</p>

<p>But, to the nation’s eternal disgrace, that generation
of Englishmen did exist, and Mr. Sadler
told the House, detail by detail, of the evils and
outrages of the whole abominable system. Excessive
hours, low wages, immorality, ill-health—all
were enumerated, and then he continued:</p>

<p>“Then in order to keep them awake, to stimulate
their exertions, means are made use of to
which I shall now advert, as a last instance of the
degradation to which this system has reduced the
manufacturing operatives of this country. Children
are beaten with thongs, prepared for the
purpose. Yes, the females of this country, no
matter whether children or grown up, and I hardly
know which is the more disgusting outrage, are
beaten, beaten in your free market of labour as
you term it, like slaves. The poor wretch is
flogged before its companions, flogged, I say, like
a dog, by the tyrant overlooker. We speak with
execration of the cartwhip of the West Indies, but
let us see this night an equal feeling rise against
the factory thong in England.”<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">454</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p>

<p>Interesting too was the fact brought out at this
time that while these were the conditions in England,
in the colonies black labour was protected
to the extent that nine hours a day was the legal
day for adults and young persons and children
were not allowed to work more than six, while
night work was simply prohibited.</p>

<p>The investigation of the Sadler Committee
evoked the interesting information from one witness
that children were never employed if they
were under five.</p>

<p>The attitude of the employers toward the agitation
can be best judged from the following extracts:</p>

<p>“Every man acquainted with the political
history of the last century must know, that the
labour of children was actually pointed out to the
manufacturers by Mr. William Pitt, as a new resource
by which they might be enabled to bear the
additional load of taxation which the necessities
of the State compelled him to impose. The necessity
for labour created by this taxation has not
yet abated; because the immense capital taken
away by the enormous expenditure of the great
wars arising out of the French Revolution, an
expenditure which was mainly supported out of
the industrial resources of the country, has not
been replaced. But even independent of these
considerations, and irrespective of a past which can
never be recalled, we mean to assert, as we have
done elsewhere, in broad terms and the plainest
language, that the infant labour, as it is erroneously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
called—or the juvenile labour, as it should be
called—in factories, is in fact a national blessing,
and absolutely necessary for the support of the
manifold fiscal burthens which have been placed
upon the industry of this country. It is quite
sufficient to say that the children of the operatives
have mouths, and must be fed; they have limbs,
and must be clothed; they have minds, which
ought to be instructed; and they have passions,
which must be controlled. Now, if the parents
are unable to provide these requisites, and their
inability to do so is just as notorious as their
existence, it becomes absolutely necessary that
the children should aid in obtaining them for
themselves. To abolish juvenile labour, is plainly
nothing else than to abolish juvenile means of support;
and to confine it within very narrow limits,
is just to subtract a dinner or a supper from the
unhappy objects of mistaken benevolence.”<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">455</a></p>

<p>The result of all this agitation and debate was
the famous Act of 1833 introduced by Lord
Shaftesbury which prohibited night work to
persons under eighteen in cotton, woollen, and
other factories, and provided that children from
nine to thirteen years of age were not to work
more than forty-eight hours a week and those
from thirteen to eighteen not to work more than
sixty-eight hours. Children under nine were not
to be employed at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span></p>

<p>Even this much was not obtained until Oastler
had succeeded in driving home to the British
mind conditions such as are described in a speech
delivered at Huddersfield, December 26, 1831, of
which the following is an extract:</p>

<p>“I will not picture fiction to you,” said Oastler,
in the early days of the factory movement, “but I
will tell you what I have seen. Take a little female
captive, six or seven years old; she shall rise from
her bed at four in the morning of a cold winter
day, but before she rises she wakes perhaps half a
dozen times, and says, ‘Father, is it time? Father,
is it time?’ And at last, when she gets up and puts
her little bits of rags upon her weary limbs—weary
yet with the last day’s work—she leaves
her parents in their bed, for their labour (if they
have any) is not required so early. She trudges
alone through rain and snow, and mire and darkness,
to the mill, and there for thirteen, fourteen,
sixteen, seventeen, or even eighteen hours is she
obliged to work with only thirty minutes’ interval
for meals and play. Homeward again at night
she would go, when she was able, but many a time
she hid herself in the wool in the mill, as she had
not strength to go. And if she were one moment
behind the appointed time; if the bell had ceased
to ring when she arrived with trembling, shivering,
weary limbs at the factory door, there stood a
monster in human form, and as she passed he lashed
her. This,” he continued, holding up an overlooker’s
strap, “is no fiction. It was hard at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
work in this town last week. The girl I am speaking
of died; but she dragged on that dreadful
existence for several years.”<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">456</a></p>

<p>While Oastler was delivering this speech and
these conditions were rife, Malthus was revising
the first edition of his <i>Essay on Population</i>.</p>

OF THE MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT THE
WORLD—ORIGIN IN NEW YORK CITY.</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>OLLOWING the Civil War, there began in
the United States a humanitarian movement,
an aftermath well becoming a
unique and heartrending struggle. In that period,
humane endeavour, like so many creepers,
overran ordinary activities, and philanthropic
movements unprecedented sprang up over the
country.</p>

<p>Labour conditions until this period were about
the same in the United States as they were in
England. The Puritan idea had been that sin
was in idleness, even for small children; “Colonial
records bear evidence that it was a matter of
conscience to keep children at work.”<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">457</a></p>

<div class="caption">THE SAME FAMILIES—AFTER ATTENTION FROM THE SOCIETY</div>
</div>

<p>In the latter half of the eighteenth century the
development of manufactures, especially the cloth-making
industry, impressed on the American
mind, as it had impressed the English mind, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>child labour was a national asset. When the
first cotton factory was started at Beverly, Mass.,
it was stated that it would afford “employment
to a great number of women and children many
of whom will be otherwise useless, if not burdensome
to society.”<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">458</a></p>

<p>A special report was made by a committee to
the Massachusetts Legislature in 1866 in which it
was stated that representatives of the factories
went about systematically canvassing for small
children: “Small help is scarce; a great deal of
machinery has been stopped for want of small
help, so that the overseers have been going around
to draw the small children from schools into the
mills; the same as a draft in the army.”</p>

<p>Asked if there were “any limit on the part of
the employers as to the age when they take children,”
a witness replied: “They’ll take them at any
age they can get them, if they are old enough to
stand....”<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></p>

<p>The same year that this report was made there
was founded in New York a Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, in imitation of a
similar society that had been founded in England,
in 1823. Out of that movement in America there
grew, in 1874, a movement to look after the rights
of children, the first enunciation in terms of modernity
of the fact that society must not only punish
crimes against children, but that it must prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
them. Following the formation of this society,
the first special laws “known in the world were
enacted specifically to protect and punish wrongs
to children.”</p>

<p>The result of this development was that in
1880 Frederick A. Agnew visited America and
after an examination of the work being done in
New York and the methods employed, returned
to Liverpool, his home, and there in conjunction
with Samuel Smith, M. P., founded the Liverpool
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
in 1883—the first society in Europe to prevent
wrongs against children. Shortly after this the
Earl of Shaftesbury organized a similar movement
in London. Then, under the auspices of the late
M. Jules Simon, whose work in behalf of children
has not yet been fully appreciated, the movement
was taken up in France, M. Paul Nourisson and
M. Ernest Nusse aiding greatly in bringing about
a comprehensive law in relation to the prevention
of cruelty to children.</p>

<p>With Lieut.-Gen. D. von Pelet-Narbonne as
chairman, the “Verein zum Schutz der Kinder vor
Ausnutzung und Misshandlung” was formed in
Berlin. In 1899 Fräulein Lydia von Wolfring
aided in the organization of the “Wiener Kinder
Schutz und Rettungs Verein” with von Krall, Privy
Chancellor of Austria, as chairman. Count Borromeo
inaugurated the movement at Milan in
Italy where the padrone system flourished to such
an extent as to indicate that the old Roman theory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
of the <i>patria potestas</i> was still alive, at least with
the peasants. Through the other countries of
Europe the interest in the new movement ran and
the work was taken up; then into India, China,
and South America, until today there is no quarter
of the globe where there is not a society, organized
for the purpose of assisting the law in preventing
crimes against the helpless child.</p>

<p>Nothing indicates better the seeming accidental
and casual beginnings of large movements than
the formation of this first society in America.
Like Vincent of Paul’s recognition of the horrible
crimes that were being perpetrated in Paris only
when he came face to face with an ill-treated
infant, so it was only when it was discovered that,
with all the law, there was no legal way of protecting
an American child, that the child-protection
movement, with its many subsequent laws in
behalf of children, sprang up.</p>

<p>A mission worker named Mrs. Etta A. Wheeler
had found in what was then the slums of New York
that a child, famous after as Mary Ellen, was being
cruelly beaten and ill-treated by a man and woman
who had taken it when it was less than two years
of age from a charitable institution. Some idea of
the condition among the slums of a large city of
this time may be gained from the statement of a
contemporary newspaper that “at least 10,000
young boys roamed the streets of New York by
day and took shelter by night in any place that
seemed to afford a safe retreat, while their older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
and more vicious confederates planned how they
should succeed in pilfering and plundering the
public. The crumbling and rotten wooden docks
of the metropolis had been for years haunted by
these young vagabonds, and as they were at that
time inefficiently policed, they were excellent
localities for the incubators of petty thievery.”</p>

<p>Unless these youngsters actually committed a
crime, or unless someone collected evidence that
they were leading an immoral life, they were free
to do what they willed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheeler was unable to gather the evidence
necessary to remove the child in which she
had become interested, and as the stories of the
cruelties continued, she went to the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, at the head of
which was Henry Bergh, whose work in this direction
was as notable in this country as was Richard
Martin’s in England.</p>

<p>After consultation with the counsel of the
Society, Elbridge T. Gerry, it was decided that
“the child being an animal” the Society would
act. Mr. Gerry after a careful examination of the
evidence, sued out a writ <i>de homine replegiando</i>,
the child was taken to court, complaints were
made against the so-called guardians, and the
woman who had cruelly beaten the child was
afterwards sent to the penitentiary for one year.</p>

<p>And so, for the first time by legal machinery,
punishment was meted out for cruelty to children.</p>

<div class="caption">THE JUVENILE COURT, NEW YORK CITY; JUSTICE WYATT ON THE BENCH</div>
</div>

<p>When it became known that the Animal Soci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>ety,
as it was called, would interest itself in children
who were being ill-treated, the complaints
became numerous. It was decided that a separate
society should be incorporated as a hand attached
to the arm of the law.</p>

<p>Of the various movements that grew out of the
protection movement, none was more interesting
or attracted more controversy than the endeavours
to protect children of the stage. We have
seen in the account of the elder Seneca and in
the treatment by the mountebanks of children
in Paris in the seventeenth century, how easily
the unprotected child lent itself to the calling of
the vagabond entertainer. While no such barbarities
were practised in modern times, it was
difficult for many people to realize that the child
of five, undergoing training as an acrobat for
long hours, was not being brought up in accordance
with the modern theory of the obligations of
the State toward the helpless.</p>

<p>The importation of children that had been sold
by their parents in Italy was also a matter that
the Society took up, and in 1879, the white
slave question, even now a live question, arose
in an endeavour to stop the <i>padroni</i> from bringing
into America the minors they had gathered
abroad.</p>

<p>Probably the most important question that has
come before the Society in recent years has been
the proper treatment of those children who, for
one reason or another, are brought into contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
with the police. One of the first things that the
New York Society did was to insist that the children
who had to be taken to court should not be
mixed with the really criminal. In 1892 an amendment
to the Penal Code made the separation imperative,
and out of this movement has grown the
children’s court movement and the proper study
of the so-called juvenile criminal.</p>

<p>Another important branch of the child-protection
movement that had its beginning in New York
City, was placing laws on the statute book, and
then enforcing them, against the sale of injurious
liquors to children. Laws tending to protect the
morality of children followed these, and in fact almost
from the first year of its birth, every year
has seen the Protection Society enlarging its field
of action until today it hardly seems possible that
it was only a few hundred years ago that the very
life of a child itself was considered of no importance.</p>

<p>The general law laid down by Spencer, in virtue
of which everything passes “from the homogeneous
to the heterogeneous, from the indefinite to
the definite, from the simple to the complex,” is
evident in the history of the progress of the child
as a factor in society.</p>

<p>When in neolithic times there was no moral
instinct in man, the child’s only hope of life was
the parental or rather the maternal instinct, of
beings not yet risen to the plain of reasoning
animals. In a higher stage of civilization one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
finds, where the matriarchal régime exists, children
have a value, the value of chattels and live stock,
though the maternal uncle has more rights over
them than their own father.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> The <i>patria potestas</i>
of the Romans was not so strange or unusual as
it seemed to Gibbon, for the power of life and
death (<i>jus vitæ ac necis</i>) is found among the
Apaches, the Botocodos, the Bedouins, and the
Samoyedes and is a stage in the development
and evolution of the family idea.</p>

<p>In the religious and philosophical stage the
child takes on an importance of its own; it is
humanely treated because it is now recognized as
a human being, or it is protected because it is
said to have, young and apparently unimportant
as it seems to be, a <i>soul</i> of its own. From there
on to the time when the child, as the father of the
man, is a charge upon the State,—or on all men,—until
it is able to take care of and protect itself,
the murder of a child is theoretically as great a
crime as the murder of an adult. In fact, the
conditions of the past hold long after each recognized
step of progress, the most primitive habits
obtruding in the very midst of the most advanced
knowledge and the most complete enlightenment.</p>

<p>It is for this that the story of the past is valuable.
That we may know and understand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
value rightly what is past, past for all time so far
as intelligent and self-governing humanity is able
to will—that is one of the surest steps to knowledge
and truth.</p>

<span class="smcap">Imperial Decree Concerning Foundlings, Abandoned
Children, and Poor Orphans
of January 19, 1811.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h3>1ST TITLE.<br /><br /></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Article I.</span> The children whose education is
entrusted to public charity are:</p>

<p>1st. Foundlings.<br />
2d. Abandoned children.<br />
3d. Poor orphans.</p>

<h3>2D TITLE.<br /><br /></h3>

<p>2. Foundlings are those born of unknown parents,
who have been found exposed in any place, or those
taken to the hospitals intended to receive them.</p>

<p>3. In each hospital intended to receive foundlings
there shall be a place where they may be left.</p>

<p>4. There will be at most in each district (<i>arrondissement</i>)
an institution where the foundlings may
be received. Registers shall state day by day, their
arrival, their sex, their apparent age, and shall describe
the natural marks and the swaddling clothes
which may serve for their identification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>

<h3>3D TITLE.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of Abandoned Children and Poor Orphans.</i></p>

<p>5. Abandoned children are those born of known
parents and at first raised by them, or by other persons
for them, and are abandoned by them, the whereabouts
of the parents being unknown or there being
no means of discovering them.</p>

<p>6. Orphans are those who, not having either father
or mother, have no means of subsistence.</p>

<h3>4TH TITLE.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Education of Foundlings, Abandoned Children,
and Orphans.</i></p>

<p>7. Newly born foundlings will be placed with a
wet nurse as soon as possible; up to that they will be
nourished by the bottle or even by means of wet
nurses resident in the establishment. If they are
weaned or susceptible of being weaned, they will either
be put to nurse or weaned.</p>

<p>8. These children will receive a layette. They will
remain to the age of six years.</p>

<p>9. At six years, all the children will be, or as
many as can, put to board with farmers. The price
of the board will increase each year up to the age
of twelve, at which period the infant males in a
state to serve will be placed at the disposition of the
Minister of the Marine.</p>

<p>10. The infants who cannot be put to board, the
crippled and the infirm, will be raised in the hospitals.
They will be occupied in the workshops at those
employments that are not below their age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

<h3>5TH TITLE.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>On the Expenses of Foundlings, Abandoned Children,
and Orphans.</i></p>

<p>11. Hospitals designated to receive foundlings
are directed to furnish the layettes and all the inside
expenses pertaining to the nourishment and education
of the children.</p>

<p>12. We herewith set aside the sum of 4,000,000
francs annually to contribute to the monthly payment
of wet nurses and the boarding of the foundlings
and abandoned children.</p>

<p>If it should turn out after the division of this sum
that it is inadequate, the difference will be provided
by the hospitals from their revenues or by drawing on
the funds of the community.</p>

<p>13. The monthly payments of the nurses and their
board shall not be made except on the certificate of the
mayors of the communities where the children are.
The mayors must attest each month that they have
seen the children.</p>

<p>14. The administrative commissioners of the
hospitals will visit at least twice in the year each
infant, either a special commission, or by physicians
or surgeons, vaccinators or others.</p>


<h3>6TH TITLE.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of the Guardianship and of Foundling Children and
Abandoned Children.</i></p>

<p>15. Foundling and abandoned children are under
the guardianship of the hospital, in conformance with
existing regulations. A member of this commission is
especially charged with this guardianship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span></p>

<p>16. The aforesaid children, brought up at the cost
of the State, are entirely at its disposition, and when
the Minister of Marine so decides, the guardianship
of the Commission ceases.</p>

<p>17. When the infants have reached the age of
twelve years, those whom the State has made no
disposition of will, as soon as it is possible to do
so, be apprenticed out, the boys with the workmen,
the girls with housewives, seamstresses, and other
workwomen in the factories or manufacturing establishments.</p>

<p>18. The contracts of apprenticeship shall not
stipulate in favour of either the master or the apprentice,
but they will guarantee the master the free
services of the apprentice up to an age which shall not
exceed the twenty-fifth year, and the apprentice food,
shelter and clothing.</p>

<p>19. At the call of the army, or a conscription,
the obligations of the apprentice will cease.</p>

<p>20. Those of the infants who cannot be put out as
apprentices, the crippled and the infirm, who cannot
find places outside of the hospitals will remain there
as a charge to each hospital.</p>

<p>Workshops will be established in order to provide
them with employment.</p>


<h3>7TH TITLE.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>On the Recognition and Announcement (Reclamation)
of Foundlings and Abandoned Children.</i></p>

<p>21. No charge is made in the rules relative to the
recognition and advertising of foundling and abandoned
children, but before exercising any right, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
parents must, if they have the means, reimburse the
authorities for all expenses made either by the State
or by the hospitals, and in no case, can an infant of
which the State has made disposition, be released
until those obligations are met.</p>


<h3>8TH TITLE.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>General “Dispositions”.</i></p>

<p>22. The Minister of the Interior will propose to us
before January 1, 1812, the rules of administration,
which will be discussed in our Council of State. These
rules will determine, for each department, the number
of hospitals where foundlings will be received and
all that relates to their administration concerning
principally the disposition of the infants now in
charge and the payment for nurses and boarding.</p>

<p>23. Individuals who are convicted of having

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>I have the honour to report as follows concerning the
treatment of children by the various races and sects
in Aleppo Consular District, viz.:</p>

<p>In many ways the treatment of children by the
various races and sects inhabiting Northern Syria
differs vastly from that practised in other countries.
Strangely similar in one particular to the custom of the
American Indian, immediately after birth the child
is wrapped in cloths until it resembles the form of a
mummy of ancient Egyptian times, in which state it is
kept and carried about by nurses and small children
until it is considered old enough to learn to walk, when
it is given the freedom of its limbs. Very young babies
must suffer considerably by this treatment, evidenced
by their constant restlessness and crying, no doubt
preventing the baby from attaining to its natural
strength and activity until after it has been free for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
some months. During cold weather a ball of a certain
kind of clay about the capacity of a quart is heated
and kept wrapped at the feet of the infant to prevent
it catching cold. Among certain of the lower classes
the illness of a girl baby does not cause the anxiety
that it does in the case of a boy, consequently causing
a much higher rate of mortality among the female
than the male children.</p>

<p>Among the Arabs, as soon as the children of the
tribesmen are six or seven years old they are put to
herding sheep and goats, which vocation they generally
follow during their lives, never going to school or
having any kind of instruction. The sons of the
sheiks (chiefs) of the tribes are either sent to school in
the cities, or a private tutor, usually a “hodja”
(Mohammedan teacher or priest), is engaged, while
the girls are given no education whatever.</p>

<p>The position of a girl varies greatly as between the
different races and sects of the country. For instance,
among the Arab and Kurdish tribes, and the Fellaheen
(non-Christian farmers), a girl is a source of revenue
to the father who, when she is of marriageable age,
trades or sells her to her prospective husband, obtaining
live stock or money to the equivalent of eight
to twenty “chees,” or $176 to $440 (a “chees” equals
$22.00), the selling price depending upon the beauty
of the girl and the prominence of her family from the
standpoint of wealth and influence. Among these
races the really fat girl commands the highest admiration.
The heavier she is the more she is desired and
the better price she brings.</p>

<p>Formerly the Christian and Hebrew families gave
their girls little schooling, but instead taught them
to do embroidery and crochet work. Among even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
relatively poor families there exists a certain pride that
causes housework to be regarded as degrading, and
only those will become servants who are forced to do so
by straitened circumstances. In late years there is
a tendency to give the girls some education, which the
Christians and Jews receive at the mission establishments
of the Americans, French, English, Italians,
Germans, Swiss, etc., while a very limited number
of Mohammedan girls attend local public schools
conducted exclusively for them.</p>

<p>Contrary to the custom prevailing among the Arabs,
Kurds, and Fellaheen, the Christians and Jews greatly
prefer to have boy babies, and it is considered a great
misfortune if most or all of the children of a family are
girls. The boys are sent to the respective community
and foreign mission schools, and some of the more
enlightened and progressive families afterwards send
their boys to the colleges at Beyrouth, Syria, to
complete their education.</p>

<p>It is the main object of every such family to marry
off the girls as soon as possible, for it is considered a
great shame to the girl if she is left unmarried until
after twenty or twenty-two years of age. Marriage
is the most important event, and the only one in
which she is in any way prominent in all her life. Her
great object in life is to become a wife and be the
mother of a boy, the latter event always raising her
in the estimation of her acquaintances and friends, and
giving her considerable importance for the time being,
whereas it is the contrary if the baby is a girl. In
many families the young wife is not permitted to speak
aloud in the presence of strangers or of the father-in-law
until a boy is born to her.</p>

<p>Parents generally engage their children at very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
early ages, in which little attention is paid to the wishes
or dislikes of the prospective bride and groom. In
fact, unborn children are sometimes provisionally
engaged to each other by their parents, either for
sentimental or financial reasons. Perhaps three-fourths
of the girls of the country are married before
they reach the age of sixteen, and many are married
between twelve and fourteen.</p>

<p>The consideration paid on the occasion of the
marriage of non-Mohammedan, or Christian and
Jewish girls, goes the other way from that paid at the
marriage of an Arab girl, it being the desire of the
groom to have as large a dowry as possible for his
wife, and which goes to help make up the family
exchequer. It consequently results that if a family
that is not well to do has many girls it is very difficult
to marry them well.</p>

<p>A certain brutality of parents towards their children
exists among the lower classes, a condition that is
probably due more to inferior intelligence caused by
lack of education than to anything else. As but a very
small minority of the population of this part of the
country, say twenty per cent., and a much smaller
proportion of the tribes of the interior read and write,
this attitude is readily understood.</p>

<p>The prevalence of crippled begging children in the
cities leads to the supposition that they are not all
deformed by accident or disease, but that in many
instances they have been purposely so rendered in
order to more profitably ply their trade by creating
sympathy in the minds of the persons addressed in
their appeals for succour. During the summer months
a considerable number of such pitiable creatures
between four and eight years old may be seen in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
streets of Aleppo, some with deformed legs, some with
spinal afflictions, and others blind or otherwise
maimed, many unable to walk and hutching from
place to place, collecting coppers from those whom
their condition touches. As the hour grows late in the
night these unfortunates gradually disappear one by
one, and if a person is interested in their destination
they may be seen to be gathered up in some obscure
corner by an apparent relative or guardian, lifted to
the shoulder and carried away into the maze of various
Oriental residential quarters, where their scanty
collection is spent in support of a family, or for the
poisonous rakee, a strong alcoholic drink much
relished by the lower element. It was suspected that
a sort of society existed whereby such children were
produced and let out to certain parties to be exploited
for their personal benefit, but no serious investigation
has ever been made, and the nefarious traffic continues.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>


<p>Yours dated November 1, 1913, has been in my
hands some time. The information you request is
rather broad, and would require much investigation
to be of any real service to you. Certainly I have
some information, in a general way, but to write it
would take much more space than a letter could
contain. But in short, the attitude of the natives of
Sierra Leon at present toward children is all of that
of a primitive people emerging into European civilization.
Children are regarded very much as a financial
asset, especially by the mothers, and are kept much
under the influence and control of the mothers so long
as they live. Those emerging out of tribal customs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
into European customs have pretty much the same
relations as exist between parents and children in
Europe or America. However, there is little love
between the child and father, generally speaking,
but much between mother and child. Boys usually
remain in the care of the mothers until they reach
the age of puberty, at which time they leave the
association of their mothers and sisters and have that
of their older brothers and fathers, almost exclusively.
Upon leaving their mothers’ care and training they
are usually, among those who cling to tribal customs,
turned over to the “medicine man,” or doctor, who
claims to know much. They are taken into the “Poro
Society” where they are circumcised, and taught the
duties of a man, the use of certain native medicines,
etc. The girls remain in the care of the mothers, but
at the age of puberty, or a little while before, are
placed into the care of one or more old women who
conduct a female school, the “bundoo” society, where
the girls have an operation performed upon them
similar to circumcision, and are taught the duties of a
mother and wife, how to care for themselves, and the
use of certain native medicines. The rule is that the
girls are not eligible for marriage until they have been
through the “bundoo,” and boys or young men not
until they have been circumcised; but in addition
boys must earn their wives by the payment of dowries—presents
to the girls’ mothers and fathers. Children
are usually required to perform such work or labor as
they are physically able to perform, strict obedience
to their parents and great respect for their seniors,
even for older brothers and sisters, though they be not
grown. Children are expected to care for and to
provide for their parents in their old age. Etc.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>In reply to your inquiry regarding the attitude of
the people of Japan toward children and the practice
of infanticide, I have the following, which is the result
of interviews with representative Japanese and of my
own observations.</p>

<p>As a rule, Japanese are very kind to children and
very fond of them; usually they are allowed their own
way a good deal when small and spoiled so that very
severe discipline is administered later in an effort to
correct this. Among the lower classes children are
very often looked upon as a sort of insurance or
investment against old age; also the system of ancestor
worship makes it a highly desirable thing to have
children, particularly sons. For these reasons children
are looked upon with great favour and large families
are the rule.</p>

<p>Infanticide is now a crime and is so strictly and
severely punished that it cannot be said to be common,
although it does exist to some extent. However, up
to about fifty years ago this was not the case; it was
not a crime and was very common. The father of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
family had supreme power over the family, even
including the power of life and death, and was free to
do with his children almost as he chose. In regions
where the people were poor, infanticide was the
regularly recognized means of preventing large families.
The following incident illustrates this very well:
In a certain section in northern Japan was a district
where so little could be produced that the people
were very poor and no family had more than one or
two children, infanticide being regularly practised.
The feudal lord of the district, being a wise man,
decided to remedy this condition, which he proceeded
to do by a system of irrigation which made the district
quite fertile; immediately the size of the families rose
to eight and ten and infanticide disappeared.</p>

<p>With regret for my long delay in answering, which
has been due to an effort to find some books on this
subject, and trusting that this may be of some slight
use to you,</p>

<p class="p padl6">

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>In reply to yours of November 1, 1913, I have not
been able to find any material of interest in regard to
the attitude of the natives before the landing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
Columbus. The ruthless attitude of the Spaniards
toward the natives is well known, and apparently
neither women nor children were spared. The treatment
of the natives resulted in their rapid decrease in
number, and as early as 1510 the traffic in African
slaves was begun and long continued.</p>

<p>Statistics as to the present condition of the child
are few. During a typical quarterly period there were
registered 8288 births (4269 males and 4019 females)
but this probably represents only a portion of the
actual births; of this number 3290 were legitimate and
4998 illegitimate. This does not, however, represent
the extreme state of immorality that it might indicate,
as mating lasting through years and clung to with
fidelity and accompanied by a tender care for the
offspring is frequently not preceded by a marriage
ceremony, which is regarded as more or less of a useless
expense. The population of the Republic is not
known but is estimated as approximating 600,000.</p>

<p>As among the Spanish races in general, great affection
is shown to children. Fathers and mothers,
brothers and sisters lavish caresses upon them continually
and in public.</p>

<p>There being few factories in the Dominican Republic,
child labour, as we know it, does not exist. Children
early begin to earn their living, but the work is mostly
in the open air or open shops and labour conditions are
far from strenuous. The clothing worn by children is
scant, and youngsters of the lower classes up to the
age of five or six years usually run nude, decorated
only by a necklace or a pair of earrings.</p>

<p>School facilities, though provided by the State, are
inadequate. The reported annual attendance at all
schools in the country is only 20,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span></p>

<p>Health conditions in the island are good. The
total deaths registered in one quarter (again short of
the real figures) is 1770, of which 318 deaths were of
children less than a year old, and 336 of children
between one and five years. The number of persons
reported guilty of crimes or disorders in one quarter
totaled 1910, of which 301 were between fourteen and
twenty-one years of age.</p>

<p>Your letter requesting information for your book
on the history of the attitude of states and tribes
toward children received. Such information as has
been obtained would indicate that the South African
natives in this section are universally kind to children.</p>

<p>The only “natives” in this district, using the words
in a strict sense, are the “Bantus” otherwise the
Kaffirs. These people are specially fond of children
and use them well.</p>

<p>If a child is left an orphan, any relative, no matter
how distant, is willing to adopt the child. Indeed the
services of the magistrate are frequently required in
deciding disputes between claimants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span></p>

<p>Love of, and kindness to, children are undoubted
characteristics of the Kaffir.</p>

<p>South Africa has a considerable population of mixed
races, but, so far as known, the colored people are kind
to their children.</p>

<p>Trusting this may meet requirements.</p>

of her motherhood, woman’s sexual nature gradually became
purer than man’s. The child became more and more the centre
of her thoughts and her deeds. Thus the strength of her erotic
instincts diminished. The tenderness awakened in her by her
children also benefited the father. Out of this tenderness—as
also out of the admiration for the manly qualities which the father
developed in the defence of herself and her children—gradually
arose the erotic feeling directed to this man alone. Thus
love began.”</p></div>

“This is a Theban law most just and humane: that no Theban
might expose his child or leave it in a wilderness, upon pain of
death. But if the father were extremely poor, whether it were
male or female, the law requires that as soon as it is born it be
brought in the swaddling clouts to the magistrate, who, receiving
it, delivers it to some other for some small reward, conditioning
with him that he shall bring up the child, and when it is
grown up take it into his service, man or maid, and have the
benefit of its labour in requital for its education.”</p></div>

sexual impulse is the formation of the family through the development
of parental affection. This instinct is as strong in
many of the lower animals as in human beings. In primitive
conditions it is largely confined to the female parent, the father
paying but slight attention to the welfare of his offspring. To
this, rather than to doubt of paternity, should we attribute the
very common habit in such communities of reckoning ancestry
in the female line only.”</p></div>

“Foochow—‘The Prefect and the local magistrates have within
the last few days issued a stringent proclamation against the
practice of female infanticide. It provides that all parents guilty
of destroying a child shall be punished according to the law
against the destruction of descendants, which, it seems, provides
sixty blows and a year’s imprisonment, as the proper punishment.
A midwife, who destroys a child, is to be punished by
strangulation. Neighbours who know of the commission, and
do not report it, are to be punished as accessories to murder;
and the Tepo are to be punished in the same way. A vigorous
execution of this proclamation would do much to remedy the
evil; but it remains to be seen whether the proclamation is more
than a periodical fulmination, with the probability that it is not.’

proclamation.

<p>
“‘“It has been found that the drowning of newly-born female
infants is of frequent occurrence in places under this prefectural
jurisdiction. As a reason for this cruel and outrageous behaviour
towards their children, the poor allege that they are without
the means to support them; the rich that they dread the expense
of providing them with dowries. The Acting Prefect has repeatedly
issued prohibitory proclamations since assuming charge
of this post, and has also instructed the magistrates to arrest
delinquents. It has been reported of late that in the neighbourhood
of Shang Kan, under the jurisdiction of the Min magistrate,
the practice of female infanticide still exists; it is further reported
that in one spot over ten infants have been found drowned, so
that there is every reason to believe that this vicious practice
extends to other places too. It is the Prefect’s duty to draw up
the most stringent supervisory regulations in order to the reclaiming
of people from this rooted habit. The Prefect has
instructed the magistrates to act in this spirit, and has now to
issue this proclamation peremptorily forbidding the practice.
</p>
<p>
“‘“Wherefore now know ye all, gentry, elders, scholars, civil
and military, and all persons whatsoever in this prefecture, that
it is your duty to act one and all of you in accordance with the
spirit of the following Regulations, and exercise a watch upon
each other. If any families are found drowning their female
infants, it will assuredly be at once reported to the magistrates,
who will severely punish the act in accordance (with law). If
any persons favour or connive at this practice and do not act
upon the instructions, on the discovery or report of a case the
hundred-men, neighbours, and relatives will be held equally
accountable. No leniency will be shown. Tremble at this!
Obey this! Do not disobey! A special proclamation.”’
</p>
<p>
“Rules relating to midwives:
</p>
<p>
“‘Female infanticide must always be practiced immediately
after birth, and is generally committed by the midwife, but even
if the parents do it themselves, the midwife must know. The
leading gentry and the hundred-men are hereby charged henceforward
to take notice of midwives in their respective villages
who may dare to assist in drowning female infants. The leading
gentry, the hundred-men, members of families, and neighbours
are authorized to ascertain and send in the names of such midwives,
and apply for their punishment as accomplices.’

<p><a name="Footnote_253_253" id="Footnote_253_253"></a><a href="#FNanchor_253_253"><span class="label">253</span></a> The Sabeans were inhabitants of the ancient kingdom of
Sheba, located in south-western Arabia. According to the
records of Mohammed Abu-Taleb Dimeshqi, the Sabeans’
sacrifices were made to the planets when they reached their
point of culmination. They sacrificed either a man or a woman
according to the divinity who was being worshipped. To the
Sun, a selected girl was sacrificed; to the Moon, a man with full
face. To Jupiter, a boy three days old, the child of the girl who
was sacrificed to the Sun. To Mercury they sacrificed a young
man of brownish colour who was a scribe and well educated; to
Mars, a very red man with a red head; to Venus, a beautiful
woman. These sacrifices were connected with various preparations
and mysterious ceremonies.
</p>
<p>
The following passage, showing the extreme of horrible barbarism,
describes one of their sacrificial ceremonies; it is from Dr.
D. Chwolsohn’s <i>Die Ssabier und der Ssabismus</i> (vol. ii., pp. 28–29).
</p>
<p>
“On the 8th of August the Sabeans pressed the wine for the
gods and called it by many different names. On this day they
sacrificed to the gods, in the middle of the forenoon, a new-born
male child. First the child was slaughtered, then boiled until it
became very soft, when the flesh was taken off (the bones). The
flesh was then kneaded with fine flour, oil, saffron, spikenard and
other spices, and, according to some, with raisins. It was then
made into small cakes of the size of a fig, and baked in a new oven.
This was used by the participants in the mystery of Shemal....
No woman, no slave or son of a slave, or no idiot was allowed
to eat of it. To the killing and the preparation of the child
only three priests were admitted. Everything remaining, such
as the bones and other things not eatable, the priests offered as
a burnt sacrifice to the gods.”

<p>
[Ab (August) Den 8. dieses Monats pressen sie neuen Wein
für die Götter und legen ihm viele verschiedene Namen bei. An
diesem Tage opfern sie in der Mitte des Vormittags den durch
Standbilder dargestellten Göttern ein neugeborenes männliches
Kind. Zuerst wird der Knabe geschlachtet und dann gesotten, bis
er ganz weich wird, dann wird das Fleisch abgenommen und
mit feinem Mehl, Safran, Spikenard, Gewürznelken und Oel (nach
der andern Lesart: Rosinen) zusammengeknetet, daraus werden
kleine Brode, von der Grösse einer Feige, gemacht (oder geknetet)
und in einem neuen (oder eisernen) Ofen gebacken. Dies dient
den Theilnehmern an dem Mysterion des Schemal (zur Speise)
für das ganze Jahr. Es darf aber kein Weib, kein Sklave, kein
Sohn einer Sklaven und kein Wahnsinniger etwas davon essen.
Zu dem Schlachten und Zurichten dieses Kindes werden blos drei
Priester zugelassen. Alles aber, was von seinen Knochen,
Gliedmassen, Knorpeln, Arterien und Nerven übrig geblieben
ist, verbrennen die Priester den Göttern zum Opfer.]</p></div>

rather amendment, of that law which gives power to fathers to
sell their children; he exempted such as were married, conditionally
that it had been with the liking and the consent of their
parents; for it seems a hard thing that a woman who had given
herself in marriage to a man she judged free, should afterwards
find herself living with a slave.”</p></div>

thought themselves guilty of a heinous offence if they suffered
their children to die without having bestowed on them some of
their property; it was consequently the custom of the women,
before exposing children, to attach to them some jewel or trinket
among their clothes, hoping thereby to avoid incurring the guilt
above mentioned, and to ease their consciences.</p></div>

Chremes tells his wife that by having given this ring, she has
done two good acts instead of one—she has both cleared her
conscience and saved the child; for had there been no ring or
token exposed with the infant, the finder would not have been
at the trouble of taking care of it, but might have left it to perish,
never suspecting it would be inquired after, or himself liberally
rewarded for having preserved it. (Bohn trans.) See chapters
xii. and xiii.</p></div>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
